   I am a full-stack developer and senior developer advocate at MongoDB as well as a Google Developer Expert for Web Technologies. I love programming and education, and create tutorials, talks, courses, and other educational content focusing on databases, serverless technologies, security, authentication, and much more. 
   
   On the front-end, I prefer building apps in React, while on the backend I often flip-flop between Node and Golang.
