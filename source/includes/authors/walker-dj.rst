   Things people tell me I'm good at. Looking at products and seeing what's missing, looking at tech news and working out its real impact and taking on trends and finding the value in them. I code, in whatever language is right for the job, as part of that process. And I like to share what I find. I've always been a coder and a writer, become a researcher and a manager, found myself being a magazine editor and I do like to mess about with technology too... that's how you find the useful bits.
