   Karen Huaulm√© (pronounced "You-Old-Maid" - but with no d's) is a Senior Developer Advocate based out of Austin, Texas where she helps MongoDB users build reliable and scalable solutions efficiently using MongoDB. When not working with MongoDB customers directly, Karen can be found playing with all the new MongoDB technologies such as Full-Text Search, Charts, Compass, and MongoDB Realm.

   Prior to joining the MongoDB team, Karen spent most of her career working with video game developers as a Solutions Architect and Integration Engineer at Nvidia, Amazon and Twitch.tv. In her spare time, Karen enjoys embarrassing her 2 kids, spoiling her dog, and feeding her addiction to adventure travel - not necessarily in that  order.
