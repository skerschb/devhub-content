   Hi, there! Joe here from MongoDB. I run the Global Developer Advocacy and Developer Content teams within the Developer Relations organisation at MongoDB. I am based in Dublin, Ireland. Always happy to answer whatever questions I can about MongoDB or broader technical topics.
   I am long time Python programmer and it is my goto hacking language. I have also dabbled in Go, C# and Node.js.
