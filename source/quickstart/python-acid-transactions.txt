Introduction to Multi-Document ACID Transactions in Python
==========================================================

.. introduction::

   Introduction
   ------------

   Multi-document transactions arrived in `MongoDB 4.0 <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community>`__ in June 2018. MongoDB has always been transactional around updates to a single document. Now, with multi-document ACID transactions we can wrap a set of database operations inside a start and commit transaction call. This ensures that even with inserts and/or updates happening across multiple collections and/or databases, the external view of the data meets `ACID constraints <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID>`__.
   
   To demonstrate transactions in the wild we use a trivial example app that emulates a flight booking for an online airline application. In this simplified booking we need to undertake three operations:
   
   - Allocate a seat in the ``seat_collection``
   - Pay for the seat in the ``payment_collection``
   - Update the count of allocated seats and sales in the ``audit_collection``
   
   For this application we will use three separate collections for these documents as detailed above. The code in ``transactions_main.py`` updates these collections in serial unless the ``--usetxns argument`` is used. We then wrap the complete set of operations inside an ACID transaction. The code in ``transactions_main.py`` is built directly using the MongoDB Python driver (`Pymongo 3.7.1 <https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/>`__).
   
   The goal of this code is to demonstrate to the Python developers just how easy it is to covert existing code to transactions if required or to port older SQL based systems.

.. prerequisites::

   Setting up your environment
   ---------------------------
   
   The following files can be found in the associated github repo, `pymongo-transactions <https://github.com/jdrumgoole/pymongo-transactions">`__.
   
   - ``gitignore`` : Standard Github .gitignore for Python.
   - ``LICENSE`` : Apache's 2.0 (standard Github) license.
   - ``Makefile`` : Makefile with targets for default operations.
   - ``transaction_main.py`` : Run a set of writes with and without transactions. Run python ``transactions_main.py -h`` for help.
   - ``transactions_retry.py`` : The file containing the transactions retry functions.
   - ``watch_transactions.py`` : Use a MongoDB change stream to watch collections as they change when transactions_main.py is running.
   - ``kill_primary.py`` : Starts a MongoDB replica set (on port 7100) and kills the primary on a regular basis. This is used to emulate an election happening in the middle of a transaction.
   - ``featurecompatibility.py`` : check and/or set feature compatibility for the database (it needs to be set to "4.0" for transactions).

   You can clone this repo and work alongside us during this blog post (please file any problems on the Issues tab in Github).

   We assume for all that follows that you have `Python 3.6 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ or greater correctly installed and on your path.
   
   The Makefile outlines the operations that are required to setup the test environment.
   
   All the programs in this example use a port range starting at **27100** to ensure that this example does not clash with an existing MongoDB installation.
   
   Preparation
   -----------

   To setup the environment you can run through the following steps manually. People that have ``make`` can speed up installation by using the ``make install`` command.
   
   Set a python virtualenv
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Check out the doc for `virtualenv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd pymongo-transactions
      $ virtualenv -p python3 venv
      $ source venv/bin/activate
   
   Install Python MongoDB Driver pymongo
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   Install the `latest version <https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/>`__ of the PyMongo MongoDB Driver (3.7.1 at the time of writing).

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install --upgrade pymongo
   
   Install mtools
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   `mtools <https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools>`__ is a collection of helper scripts to parse, filter, and visualize MongoDB log files (mongod, mongos). mtools also includes ``mlaunch``, a utility to quickly set up complex MongoDB test environments on a local machine. For this demo we are only going to use the `mlaunch <http://blog.rueckstiess.com/mtools/mlaunch.html>`__ program.

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install mtools
   
   The ``mlaunch`` program also requires the `psutil <https://pypi.org/project/psutil/>`__ package.
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install psutil
   
   The ``mlaunch`` program gives us a simple command to start a MongoDB replica set as transactions are only supported on a replica set.
   
   Start a replica set whose name is **txntest**. See the ``make init_server`` make target for details:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mlaunch init --port 27100 --replicaset --name "txntest"
   
   Using the Makefile for configuration
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   There is a ``Makefile`` with targets for all these operations. For those of you on platforms without access to Make, it should be easy enough to cut and paste the commands out of the targets and run them on the command line.
   
   Running the ``Makefile``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd pymongo-transactions
      $ make

   You will need to have MongoDB 4.0 on your path. There are other convenience targets for starting the demo programs:

   - ``make notxns`` : start the transactions client without using transactions.
   - ``make usetxns`` : start the transactions client with transactions enabled.
   - ``make watch_seats`` : watch the seats collection changing.
   - ``make watch_payments`` : watch the payment collection changing.

   Running the transactions example
   --------------------------------
   
   The transactions example consists of two python programs.

   - ``transaction_main.py``,
   - ``watch_transactions.py``.
   
   Running transactions_main.py
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. code-block:: none
   
      $ python transaction_main.py -h
      usage: transaction_main.py [-h] [--host HOST] [--usetxns] [--delay DELAY]
                                 [--iterations ITERATIONS]
                                 [--randdelay RANDDELAY RANDDELAY]

      optional arguments:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        --host HOST           MongoDB URI [default: mongodb://localhost:27100,localh
                              ost:27101,localhost:27102/?replicaSet=txntest&retryWri
                              tes=true]
        --usetxns             Use transactions [default: False]
        --delay DELAY         Delay between two insertion events [default: 1.0]
        --iterations ITERATIONS
                              Run N iterations. O means run forever
        --randdelay RANDDELAY RANDDELAY
                              Create a delay set randomly between the two bounds
                              [default: None]

   You can choose to use ``--delay`` or ``--randdelay``. If you use both --delay takes precedence. The ``--randdelay`` parameter creates a random delay between a lower and an upper bound that will be added between each insertion event.
   
   The ``transactions_main.py`` program knows to use the **txntest** replica set and the right default port range.
   
   To run the program without transactions you can run it with no arguments:

   .. code-block:: none
   
      $ python transaction_main.py
      using collection: SEATSDB.seats
      using collection: PAYMENTSDB.payments
      using collection: AUDITDB.audit
      Using a fixed delay of 1.0

      1. Booking seat: '1A'
      1. Sleeping: 1.000
      1. Paying 330 for seat '1A'
      2. Booking seat: '2A'
      2. Sleeping: 1.000
      2. Paying 450 for seat '2A'
      3. Booking seat: '3A'
      3. Sleeping: 1.000
      3. Paying 490 for seat '3A'
      4. Booking seat: '4A'
      4. Sleeping: 1.000
      ^C
   
   The program runs a function called ``book_seat()`` which books a seat on a plane by adding documents to three collections. First it adds the seat allocation to the ``seats_collection``, then it adds a payment to the ``payments_collection``, finally it updates an audit count in the ``audit_collection``. (This is a much simplified booking process used purely for illustration).
   
   The default is to run the program **without** using transactions. To use transactions we have to add the command line flag ``--usetxns``. Run this to test that you are running MongoDB 4.0 and that the correct `featureCompatibility <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/>`__ is configured (it must be set to 4.0). If you install MongoDB 4.0 over an existing ``/data`` directory containing 3.6 databases then featureCompatibility will be set to 3.6 by default and transactions will not be available.

   .. blockquote::

      Note: If you get the following error running python ``transaction_main.py --usetxns`` that means you are picking up an older version of pymongo (older than 3.7.x) for which there is no multi-document transactions support.

   .. code-block:: none

      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "transaction_main.py", line 175, in

        File "/Users/jdrumgoole/GIT/pymongo-transactions/transaction_retry.py", line 52, in run_transaction_with_retry
          with session.start_transaction():
      AttributeError: 'ClientSession' object has no attribute 'start_transaction'

   Watching Transactions
   ---------------------
   
   To actually see the effect of transactions we need to watch what is happening inside the collections ``SEATSDB.seats`` and ``PAYMENTSDB.payments``.
   
   We can do this with ``watch_transactions.py``. This script uses `MongoDB Change Streams <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/>`__ to see what's happening inside a collection in real-time. We need to run two of these in parallel so it's best to line them up side by side.
   
   Here is the ``watch_transactions.py`` program:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ python watch_transactions.py -h
      usage: watch_transactions.py [-h] [--host HOST] [--collection COLLECTION]
   
      optional arguments:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        --host HOST           mongodb URI for connecting to server [default:
                              mongodb://localhost:27100/?replicaSet=txntest]
        --collection COLLECTION
                              Watch  [default:
                              PYTHON_TXNS_EXAMPLE.seats_collection]
   
   We need to watch each collection so in two separate terminal windows start the watcher.
   
   Window 1:

   .. code-block:: none
   
      $ python watch_transactions.py --watch seats
      Watching: seats
      ...
   
   
   Window 2:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ python watch_transactions.py --watch payments
      Watching: payments
      ...

   What happens when you run without transactions?
   -----------------------------------------------
   
   Lets run the code without transactions first. If you examine the ``transaction_main.py`` code you will see a function ``book_seats``.

   .. code-block:: python

      def book_seat(seats, payments, audit, seat_no, delay_range, session=None):
          '''
          Run two inserts in sequence.
          If session is not None we are in a transaction

          :param seats: seats collection
          :param payments: payments collection
          :param seat_no: the number of the seat to be booked (defaults to row A)
          :param delay_range: A tuple indicating a random delay between two ranges or a single float fixed delay
          :param session: Session object required by a MongoDB transaction
          :return: the delay_period for this transaction
          '''
          price = random.randrange(200, 500, 10)
          if type(delay_range) == tuple:
              delay_period = random.uniform(delay_range[0], delay_range[1])
          else:
              delay_period = delay_range

          # Book Seat
          seat_str = "{}A".format(seat_no)
          print(count( i, "Booking seat: '{}'".format(seat_str)))
          seats.insert_one({"flight_no" : "EI178",
                            "seat"      : seat_str,
                            "date"      : datetime.datetime.utcnow()},
                           session=session)
          print(count( seat_no, "Sleeping: {:02.3f}".format(delay_period)))
          #pay for seat
          time.sleep(delay_period)
          payments.insert_one({"flight_no" : "EI178",
                               "seat"      : seat_str,
                               "date"      : datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
                               "price"     : price},
                              session=session)
          audit.update_one({ "audit" : "seats"}, { "$inc" : { "count" : 1}}, upsert=True)
          print(count(seat_no, "Paying {} for seat '{}'".format(price, seat_str)))

          return delay_period
   
   
   This program emulates a very simplified airline booking with a seat being allocated and then paid for. These are often separated by a reasonable time frame (e.g. seat allocation vs external credit card validation and anti-fraud check) and we emulate this by inserting a delay. The default is 1 second.
   
   Now with the two ``watch_transactions.py`` scripts running for ``seats_collection`` and ``payments_collection`` we can run ``transactions_main.py`` as follows:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ python transaction_main.py
   
   The first run is with no transactions enabled.
   
   The bottom window shows ``transactions_main.py`` running. On the top left we are watching the inserts to the seats collection. On the top right we are watching inserts to the payments collection.

   .. image:: /images/python-without-transactions.png
      :width: 760px
      :alt: watching without transactions

   We can see that the payments window lags the seats window as the watchers only update when the insert is complete. Thus seats sold cannot be easily reconciled with corresponding payments. If after the third seat has been booked we CTRL-C the program we can see that the program exits before writing the payment. This is reflected in the Change Stream for the payments collection which only shows payments for seat 1A and 2A versus seat allocations for 1A, 2A and 3A.
   
   If we want payments and seats to be instantly reconcilable and consistent we must execute the inserts inside a transaction.
   
   What happens when you run with Transactions?
   --------------------------------------------
   
   Now lets run the same system with ``--usetxns`` enabled.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ python transaction_main.py --usetxns
   
   We run with the exact same setup but now set ``--usetxns``.

   .. image:: /images/python-with-transactions.png
      :width: 760px
      :alt: watching with transactions

   Note now how the change streams are interlocked and are updated in parallel. This is because all the updates only become visible when the transaction is committed. Note how we aborted the third transaction by hitting CTRL-C. Now neither the seat nor the payment appear in the change streams unlike the first example where the seat went through.
   
   This is where transactions shine in world where all or nothing is the watchword. We never want to keeps seats allocated unless they are paid for.
   
   What happens during failure?
   ----------------------------
   
   In a MongoDB replica set all writes are directed to the Primary node. If the primary node fails or becomes inaccessible (e.g. due to a network partition) writes in flight may fail. In a non-transactional scenario the driver will recover from a single failure and `retry the write <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/retryable-writes/>`__. In a multi-document transaction we must recover and retry in the event of these kinds of transient failures. This code is encapsulated in ``transaction_retry.py``. We both retry the transaction and retry the commit to handle scenarios where the primary fails within the transaction and/or the commit operation.

   .. code-block:: python

      def commit_with_retry(session):
          while True:
              try:
                  # Commit uses write concern set at transaction start.
                  session.commit_transaction()
                  print("Transaction committed.")
                  break
              except (pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure, pymongo.errors.OperationFailure) as exc:
                  # Can retry commit
                  if exc.has_error_label("UnknownTransactionCommitResult"):
                      print("UnknownTransactionCommitResult, retrying "
                            "commit operation ...")
                      continue
                  else:
                      print("Error during commit ...")
                      raise

      def run_transaction_with_retry(functor, session):
          assert (isinstance(functor, Transaction_Functor))
          while True:
              try:
                  with session.start_transaction():
                      result=functor(session)  # performs transaction
                      commit_with_retry(session)
                  break
              except (pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure, pymongo.errors.OperationFailure) as exc:
                  # If transient error, retry the whole transaction
                  if exc.has_error_label("TransientTransactionError"):
                      print("TransientTransactionError, retrying "
                            "transaction ...")
                      continue
                  else:
                      raise

          return result
   
   In order to observe what happens during elections we can use the script ``kill_primary.py``. This script will start a replica-set and continuously kill the primary.

   .. code-block:: none

      $ make kill_primary
      . venv/bin/activate && python kill_primary.py
      no nodes started.
      Current electionTimeoutMillis: 500
      1. (Re)starting replica-set
      no nodes started.

      Process list written to mlaunch.procs
      1. Getting replica set status
      1. Killing primary node: 31029
      1. Sleeping: 1.0
      2. (Re)starting replica-set
      launching: "/usr/local/mongodb/bin/mongod" on port 27101
      2. Getting list of mongod processes
      Process list written to mlaunch.procs
      2. Getting replica set status
      2. Killing primary node: 31045
      2. Sleeping: 1.0
      3. (Re)starting replica-set
      launching: "/usr/local/mongodb/bin/mongod" on port 27102
      3. Getting list of mongod processes
      Process list written to mlaunch.procs
      3. Getting replica set status
      3. Killing primary node: 31137
      3. Sleeping: 1.0
   
   
   ``kill_primary.py`` resets `electionTimeOutMillis <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/replica-configuration/index.html#rsconf.settings.electionTimeoutMillis>`__ to 500ms from its default of 10000ms (10 seconds). This allows elections to resolve more quickly for the purposes of this test as we are running everything locally.
   
   Once ``kill_primary.py`` is running we can start up ``transactions_main.py`` again using the ``--usetxns`` argument.

   .. code-block:: none
   
      $ make usetxns
      . venv/bin/activate && python transaction_main.py --usetxns
      Forcing collection creation (you can't create collections inside a txn)

      Transaction committed.
      5. Booking seat: '5A'

      6. Booking seat: '6A'
      6. Sleeping: 1.000
      6. Paying 380 for seat '6A'
      Transaction committed.
      ...
   
   
   As you can see during elections the transaction will be aborted and must be retried. If you look at the ``transaction_rety.py`` code you will see how this happens. If a write operation encounters an error it will throw one of the following exceptions:

   - `pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure <http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/api/pymongo/errors.html>`__
   - `pymongo.errors.OperationFailure <http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/api/pymongo/errors.html>`__

   Within these exceptions there will be a label called `TransientTransactionError <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/transactions/#transactions-api>`__. This label can be detected using the ``has_error_label(label)`` function which is available in pymongo 3.7.x. Transient errors can be recovered from and the retry code in ``transactions_retry.py`` has code that retries for both writes and commits (see above).

   Conclusion
   ----------

   Multi-document transactions are the final piece of the jigsaw for SQL developers who have been shying away from trying MongoDB. ACID transactions make the programmer's job easier and give teams that are migrating from an existing SQL schema a much more consistent and convenient transition path.
   
   As most migrations involving a move from highly normalised data structures to more natural and flexible nested JSON documents one would expect that the number of required multi-document transactions will be less in a properly constructed MongoDB application. But where multi-document transactions are required programmers can now include them using very similar syntax to SQL.
   
   With ACID transactions in MongoDB 4.0 it can now be the first choice for an even broader range of application use cases.
