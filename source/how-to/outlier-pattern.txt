Building with Patterns: The Outlier Pattern
===========================================

.. introduction::
   So far in this *Building with Patterns* series, we’ve looked at the
   :doc:`Polymorphic </how-to/polymorphic-pattern>`,
   :doc:`Attribute </how-to/attribute-pattern>``,
   and
   :doc:`Bucket </how-to/bucket-pattern>``
   patterns. While the document schema in these patterns has slight
   variations, from an application and query standpoint, the document
   structures are fairly consistent. What happens, however, when this isn’t
   the case? What happens when there is data that falls outside the
   “normal” pattern? What if there’s an outlier?

   Imagine you are starting an e-commerce site that sells books. One of the
   queries you might be interested in running is “who has purchased a
   particular book”. This could be useful for a recommendation system to
   show your customers similar books of interest. You decide to store the
   ``user_id`` of a customer in an array for each book. Simple enough,
   right?

   Well, this may indeed work for 99.99% of the cases, but what happens
   when J.K. Rowling releases a new Harry Potter book and sales spike in
   the millions? The 16MB `BSON
   document <https://www.mongodb.com/json-and-bson>`__ size limit could
   easily be reached. Redesigning our entire application for this *outlier*
   situation could result in reduced performance for the typical book, but
   we do need to take it into consideration.

   The Outlier Pattern
   -------------------

   With the Outlier Pattern, we are working to prevent a few queries or
   documents driving our solution towards one that would not be optimal for
   the majority of our use cases. Not every book sold will sell millions of
   copies.

   A typical ``book`` document storing ``user_id`` information might look
   something like:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
          "_id": ObjectID("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011")
          "title": "A Genealogical Record of a Line of Alger",
          "author": "Ken W. Alger",
          …,
          "customers_purchased": ["user00", "user01", "user02"]

      }

   This would work well for a large majority of books that aren’t likely to
   reach the “best seller” lists. Accounting for outliers though results in
   the ``customers_purchased`` array expanding beyond a 1000 item limit we
   have set, we’ll add a new field to “flag” the book as an outlier.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
          "_id": ObjectID("507f191e810c19729de860ea"),
          "title": "Harry Potter, the Next Chapter",
          "author": "J.K. Rowling",
          …,
         "customers_purchased": ["user00", "user01", "user02", …, "user999"],
         "has_extras": "true"
      }

   We’d then move the overflow information into a separate document linked
   with the book’s ``id``. Inside the application, we would be able to
   determine if a document has a ``has_extras`` field with a value of
   ``true``. If that is the case, the application would retrieve the extra
   information. This could be handled so that it is rather transparent for
   most of the application code.

   Many design decisions will be based on the application workload, so this
   solution is intended to show an example of the Outlier Pattern. The
   important concept to grasp here is that the outliers have a substantial
   enough difference in their data that, if they were considered “normal”,
   changing the application design for them would degrade performance for
   the more typical queries and documents.

   Sample Use Case
   ---------------

   The Outlier Pattern is an advanced pattern, but one that can result in
   large performance improvements. It is frequently used in situations when
   popularity is a factor, such as in social network relationships, book
   sales, movie reviews, etc. The Internet has transformed our world into a
   much smaller place and when something becomes popular, it transforms the
   way we need to model the data around the item.

   One example is a customer that has a video conferencing product. The
   list of authorized attendees in most video conferences can be kept in
   the same document as the conference. However, there are a few events,
   like a company’s all hands, that have thousands of expected attendees.
   For those outlier conferences, the customer implemented “overflow”
   documents to record those long lists of attendees.

.. summary::

   Conclusion
   ----------

   The problem that the Outlier Pattern addresses is preventing a few
   documents or queries to determine an application’s solution. Especially
   when that solution would not be optimal for the majority of use cases.
   We can leverage MongoDB’s flexible data model to add a field to the
   document “flagging” it as an outlier. Then, inside the application, we
   handle the outliers slightly differently. By tailoring your schema for
   the typical document or query, application performance will be optimized
   for those normal use cases and the outliers will still be addressed.

   One thing to consider with this pattern is that it often is tailored for
   specific queries and situations. Therefore, ad hoc queries may result in
   less than optimal performance. Additionally, as much of the work is done
   within the application code itself, additional code maintenance may be
   required over time.

   In our next *Building with Patterns* post, we’ll take a look at the
   `Computed
   Pattern <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-computed-pattern>`__
   and how to optimize schema for applications that can result in
   unnecessary waste of resources.
