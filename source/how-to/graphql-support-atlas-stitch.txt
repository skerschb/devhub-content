Introducing GraphQL Support in MongoDB Atlas with Stitch
========================================================

.. content::

    We’re pleased to announce that you can now interact with your MongoDB
    documents using the GraphQL standard in your JavaScript applications by
    leveraging Stitch integration in your MongoDB Atlas cluster!

    So what does this mean, why is it important, and how exactly do you make
    this happen?

    What is GraphQL
    ---------------

    If you’ve never heard of `GraphQL <https://graphql.org/>`__ before, you
    can think of it as a query language for APIs. Rather than making simple
    HTTP requests to an API endpoint and receiving the full payload of that
    resource as a response, you can use GraphQL to query for only the fields
    you want, similar to a `MongoDB
    projection <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results/>`__
    or a SQL query.

    By specifying the fields you want returned, you’re now decreasing the
    size of the response payload, boosting the performance of your
    application, and writing cleaner code.

    Why is GraphQL in MongoDB a Big Deal
    ------------------------------------

    Until now, being able to use GraphQL in your applications required a
    dedicated web service that contained schema information, resolve
    functions with database logic, and other middleware logic, such as
    authentication and authorization, to sit between the database and the
    client facing application.

    Building a GraphQL backend, while not an incredibly complicated task,
    takes time, requires maintenance, and has certain fees associated to it
    in regards to hosting.

    Removing the need for a GraphQL backend by leveraging Stitch for
    authentication and GraphQL queries and mutations is a huge win for
    MongoDB and developers on the platform. It is yet another way that
    MongoDB is working to make the data layer stunningly easy for developers
    to work with.

    Interacting with MongoDB Documents through the Stitch Dashboard
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    To use GraphQL for querying and mutating documents directly in the
    MongoDB platform, a few configurations must be made.

    The following will give you an idea of what must be done:

    -  A database and at least one collection must be created in your
       MongoDB Atlas cluster.
    -  A MongoDB Stitch application must be created and linked to the
       cluster.
    -  User rules must be defined for the database and collection within
       Stitch.
    -  A Stitch schema must be defined.

    It doesn’t take more than a few minutes to accomplish each of the above
    items. I’m going to break it down for you to make it easy.

    Create a MongoDB Atlas Cluster with a Database and Collection
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The first thing we want to do is make sure we have a cluster created and
    configured within `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud>`__. If
    this is your first time being exposed to Atlas, it is a cloud hosted
    version of MongoDB, and it contains a forever free "M0" tier to get you
    started.

        promotional code `NICRABOY200 <https://www.mongdb.com/cloud>`__ to
        receive credits towards building a more powerful cluster.

    Within Atlas, click the **COLLECTIONS** button on your desired cluster.

    .. figure:: /images/how-to/mongodb-cluster-1-1thl0nargy.jpg
        :alt: MongoDB Atlas Cluster

    To get started, we’re going to create a single database and collection
    for use with Stitch. If one doesn’t already exist, choose **Add my own
    data** when prompted.

    .. figure:: /images/how-to/mongodb-cluster-2-ttf20tmxdz.jpg
        :alt: MongoDB Atlas New Database

    While out of the scope of this example, you could also play around with
    the `sample data <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/>`__ found
    in MongoDB Atlas.

    After choosing to create the new database and collection, you should be
    brought into the data and schema explorer part of the MongoDB Atlas
    dashboard. If you’re starting with a fresh database and schema, you
    won’t have any data as of now.

    .. figure:: /images/how-to/mongodb-cluster-3-u4gps2mi7y.jpg
        :alt: MongoDB Atlas Explorer

    At this point in time, MongoDB Atlas is configured enough to move onto
    the next step which involves creating a Stitch application and linking
    it to the database and collection.

    Configuring MongoDB Stitch to Integrate with the Atlas Cluster
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    To connect your cluster to Stitch, you need to create an application.
    This is not an application like one you’d develop, but more in the sense
    that Stitch is providing the backend components required to support your
    web or mobile application.

    Almost anywhere within the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, click **Stitch**
    within the **Services** section of the navigation.

    .. figure:: /images/how-to/mongodb-stitch-1-2dzzh2ih6q.jpg
        :alt: MongoDB Stitch

    After navigating to the Stitch service, you’ll be asked to create a new
    application if one doesn’t already exist. This is where you’ll define
    information like the application name, the cluster in question, and any
    other deployment information.

    .. figure:: /images/how-to/mongodb-stitch-2-n8tiqh2ygl.jpg
        :alt: MongoDB Stitch

    Once created, you’ll be brought to the Stitch dashboard for your
    particular application. When you develop your application outside of
    Stitch, you’ll probably want some form of authentication so that people
    can access only the documents that they own.

    To get the most simple authentication going, choose to enable
    **Anonymous Authentication Enabled**, as it will be used for the example
    in this tutorial.

    Defining User Rules for Data Access within Stitch
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    With the Stitch application connected to the MongoDB Atlas cluster, we
    need to define access rules for our users.

    In the navigation bar, choose **Rules** and select the collection that
    we wish to configure. In my example, I’m using **demo** as the database
    and **tasks** as the collection.

    .. figure:: /images/how-to/mongodb-stitch-rules-1-dj33ggx1vv.jpg
        :alt: MongoDB Stitch Rules

    You’ll want to choose a permissions template for the collection. In our
    example we want users to be only able to read their own data. For this
    template, we need to define which field in our MongoDB documents will
    contain the user id. The actual user id is created after the user
    authenticates, but for this example **owner_id** is going to represent
    it. This configuration rule will ensure that when an authenticated user
    makes a request, only documents where the **owner_id** field is equal to
    the id of the user will be returned.

    Creating a Schema within MongoDB Stitch
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    For Stitch to automatically generate possible queries and mutations, it
    needs to understand how the documents can be modeled. To do this, a
    schema needs to be defined within the **Rules** section of the Stitch
    dashboard.

    You can either create your schema manually for any given collection, or
    you can choose to generate the schema automatically. Generating the
    schema automatically will result in a defined number of documents to be
    evaluated within the collection to get the result.

    Here is an example of a possible schema for the particular collection:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "properties": {
                "_id": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
                "name": { "bsonType": "string" },
                "description": { "bsonType": "string" },
                "tags": {
                    "bsonType": "array",
                    "uniqueItems": true,
                    "items": {
                        "bsonType": "string"
                    }
                },
                "owner_id": { "bsonType": "string" },
                "createdAt": { "bsonType": "date" }
            }
        }

    While a little more extravagant than we need, I just wanted to show that
    you can have complexity in your schema through the above example.

    MongoDB doesn’t have a schema by default, but GraphQL requires a strict
    type system. Using a JSON schema allows you to map your data in MongoDB
    and enables Stitch to automatically generate a full GraphQL schema. The
    schema you define in Stitch is only related to your application and it
    doesn’t affect any other workloads on your MongoDB cluster. It simply
    ensures that the data passed to GraphQL doesn’t create errors. If you’re
    not sure whether the schema you’ve created matches your data, Stitch
    also includes validation that will flag inconsistencies between your
    schema and data.

    When you’ve defined your schema, make sure you click the **SAVE**
    button.

    .. figure:: /images/how-to/mongodb-stitch-schema-1-wy5bmgkao4.jpg
        :alt: MongoDB Stitch Schema

    Don’t forget to also review and deploy the changes you made so they are
    live and ready to be worked with.

    Interacting with GraphQL using the Integrated GraphiQL Interface
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    With the cluster linked to a Stitch application and the rules and schema
    information in place, we can proceed to the GraphQL side of things.

    Within the Stitch dashboard, choose the **GraphQL** tab from the
    navigation.

    If you’ve ever dabbled with GraphQL, the interface that Stitch offers
    might look familiar. It uses GraphiQL as a way to interact with and
    explore the collection using GraphQL queries and mutations.

    .. figure:: /images/how-to/mongodb-stitch-graphql-1-6vbv6ak0al.jpg
        :alt: MongoDB Stitch GraphQL

    To get an idea of what queries and mutations are available, take a look
    at the **Document Explorer** within GraphiQL. If you click on **Query**
    or **Mutation**, you’ll get a list of what’s available for the
    particular application. This is based on what you had entered in your
    schema definition for Stitch.

    At this point in time you have a fully capable GraphQL endpoint.

    Creating a Simple JavaScript Application with GraphQL Support
    -------------------------------------------------------------

    Interacting with MongoDB documents through GraphiQL and the Stitch
    dashboard is great, but in most circumstances you’re going to want to do
    this from your own web or mobile applications.

    The Stitch SDK, along with common JavaScript packages and frameworks,
    makes this an easy process. We’re going to create a very basic
    application to get you started in the right direction.

    For this example we’re going to use the following:

    -  MongoDB Stitch SDK 4.6.0+
    -  Axios

    The Stitch SDK will allow us to interact with Stitch specific features
    such as authentication while Axios will give us an easy set of commands
    for making HTTP requests to the GraphQL endpoint that we’ve configured
    for our collection. Axios is not a requirement, but it is my personal
    preference when making HTTP requests with JavaScript.

    Create an **index.html** file on your computer with the following
    boilerplate code:

    .. code-block:: auto

        <html>
            <head></head>
            <body>
                <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
                <script src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/js/bundles/4.6.0/stitch.js"></script>
                <script>
                    // Logic here...
                </script>
            </body>
        </html>

    The thought process behind this very simple application is as follows:

    1. Configure the connection of Stitch to the JavaScript application
    2. Anonymously authenticate users
    3. Create a new document through a GraphQL mutation
    4. Find documents through a GraphQL query

    To work through this, let’s start adding some logic to the application
    in the ``<script>`` tag.

    Within the ``<script>`` tag, add the following:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        const client = stitch.Stitch.initializeDefaultAppClient("example-auuce");

    The ``initializeDefaultAppClient`` will take the application id for your
    Stitch application to create a client.

    The next step is authentication. This is an asynchronous event, so you
    should either be using promises or the more modern async and await
    approach. Take the following for example:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        (async () => {
            try {
                const user = await client.auth.loginWithCredential(new stitch.AnonymousCredential());
                console.info(user);
                // GraphQL Logic Here...
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(error);
            }
        })();

    The above snippet will attempt anonymous authentication. If it is
    successful, the user information will be printed to the console. What’s
    important in this response is the id, which is the owner id for our
    documents and the access token that we send with future requests to
    prove we are who we say we are.

    At this point we have our owner information and we want to create new
    documents using a GraphQL mutation. We can do something like the
    following:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        (async () => {
            try {
                const user = await client.auth.loginWithCredential(new stitch.AnonymousCredential());
                console.info(user);

                const task = {
                    "name": "Test Name",
                    "description": "Test Description",
                    "owner_id": user.id
                }

                const resp = await axios({
                    url: 'https://stitch.mongodb.com/api/client/v2.0/app/example-auuce/graphql',
                    method: 'post',
                    headers: {
                        'Authorization': `Bearer ${user.auth.activeUserAuthInfo.accessToken}`
                    },
                    data: {
                        query: `
                            mutation($data:TasksInsertInput!){
                                insertOneTasks(data:$data){
                                    _id,
                                    description,
                                    name
                                }
                            }
                        `,
                        variables: {
                            data: task
                        }
                    }
                });
                console.log(resp);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(error);
            }
        })();

    In the above example we are creating a ``task`` object modeled the same
    as our Stitch schema, minus a few fields. The ``owner_id`` is pulled
    from the response of the anonymous authentication.

    To make the GraphQL request from JavaScript, there are many ways to do
    this, but like I mentioned, Axios is my personal favorite. To make the
    request, you’ll need the endpoint from the Stitch dashboard. You’ll want
    to get it from the page where we played around with GraphiQL.

    The authorization token can be obtained from the successful
    authentication attempt. The payload of the request is a GraphQL mutation
    and the appropriate variables that should be passed from the
    application. In this case the variable is the ``task`` that was created
    prior.

    Because the ``insertOneTasks`` mutation lists ``_id``, ``description``,
    and ``name``, this is the data that will be returned and printed when
    the request is successful.

    You can look to see if this data truly exists in Atlas, by looking at
    the data explorer for the collection. We can also try to run another
    GraphQL query:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        (async () => {
            try {
                const user = await client.auth.loginWithCredential(new stitch.AnonymousCredential());
                console.info(user);
                const resp = await axios({
                    url: 'https://stitch.mongodb.com/api/client/v2.0/app/example-auuce/graphql',
                    method: 'post',
                    headers: {
                        'Authorization': `Bearer ${user.auth.activeUserAuthInfo.accessToken}`
                    },
                    data: {
                        query: `
                            {
                                taskss{
                                    name,
                                    description
                                }
                            }
                        `
                    }
                });
                console.log(resp);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(error);
            }
        })();

    The request is more or less the same, just this time a different GraphQL
    query.

    More Examples and Help with MongoDB and GraphQL
    -----------------------------------------------

    To get more hands on experience with using GraphQL with MongoDB using
    Stitch, there are a few more projects you can look at to give you a bump
    in the right direction.

    -  `MongoDB GraphQL Example with React and Apollo <https://github.com/JoeKarlsson/mongodb-graphql-demo>`__
    -  `Todo List with React and Axios <https://github.com/mongodb-appeng/taskit>`__

    While both of the above examples leverage React, a popular web
    development framework, they demonstrate interacting with GraphQL using
    different client packages.

    Conclusion
    ----------

    GraphQL becoming integrated into MongoDB Stitch is a huge thing as
    GraphQL is a widely adopted query language for APIs. Not having to
    create a custom backend implementation of GraphQL can save your
    development teams a lot of time and resources.
