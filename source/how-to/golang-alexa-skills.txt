Developing Alexa Skills with MongoDB and Golang
===============================================

.. content::

    The popularity of `Amazon
    Alexa <https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa>`__ and virtual
    assistants in general is no question, huge. Having a web application and
    mobile application isn't enough for most organizations anymore, and now
    you need to start supporting voice operated applications.

    So what does it take to create something for Alexa? How different is it
    from creating a web application?

    In this tutorial we're going to see how to create an Amazon Alexa Skill,
    also referred to as an Alexa application, that interacts with a MongoDB
    cluster using the Go programming language (Golang) and AWS Lambda.

    The Requirements
    ----------------

    A few requirements must be met prior to starting this tutorial:

    - Golang must be installed and configured
    - A MongoDB Atlas cluster

    If you don't have a `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud>`__
    cluster, you can configure one for free. For this example an M0 cluster
    is more than sufficient.

    .. blockquote::

        Using promotional code NICRABOY200 will give you $200 in premium
        credit on your Atlas account for a more powerful cluster beyond the
        forever free M0 cluster.

    Make sure the Atlas cluster has been properly whitelisted for AWS
    services. If AWS Lambda cannot reach your cluster then requests made by
    Alexa will fail.

    Having an Amazon Echo or other Amazon Alexa enabled device is not
    necessary to be successful with this tutorial. Amazon offers a really
    great simulator that can be used directly in the web browser.

    Designing an Alexa Skill with an Invocation Term and Sample Utterances
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    When it comes to building an Alexa Skill, it doesn't matter if you start
    with the code or the design. For this tutorial we're going to start with
    the design, directly in the `Amazon Developer
    Portal <https://developer.amazon.com>`__ for Alexa.

    Sign into the portal and choose to create a new custom Skill. After
    creating the Skill, you'll be brought to a dashboard with several
    checklist items:

    .. figure:: /images/how-to/amazon-alexa-portal-j4mv42a9lt.png
        :alt: Amazon Alexa Portal

    In the checklist, you should take note of the following:

    - Invocation Name
    - Intents, Samples, and Slots
    - Endpoint

    There are other items, one being optional and the other being checked
    naturally as the others complete.

    The first step is to define the invocation name. This is the name that
    users will use when they speak to their virtual assistant. It should not
    be confused with the Skill name because the two do not need to match.
    The Skill name is what would appear in the online marketplace.

    For our invocation name, let's use **recipe manager**, something that is
    easy to remember and easy to pronounce. With the invocation name in
    place, we can anticipate using our Skill like the following:

    .. code-block:: none

        Alexa, ask Recipe Manager to INTENT

    The user would not literally speak **INTENT** in the command. The intent
    is the command that will be defined through sample utterances, also
    known as sample phrases or data. You can, and probably should, have
    multiple intents for your Skill.

    Let's start by creating an intent titled
    **GetIngredientsForRecipeIntent** with the following sample utterances:

    .. code-block:: none

        what ingredients do i need for {recipe}
        what do i need to cook {recipe}
        to cook {recipe} what ingredients do i need

    There are a few things to note about the above phrases:

    - The ``{recipe}`` tag is a slot variable which is going to be user
      defined when spoken.
    - Every possible spoken phrase to execute the command should be listed.

    Alexa operates from machine learning, so the more sample data the
    better. When defining the ``{recipe}`` variable, it should be assigned a
    type of ``AMAZON.Food``.

    When all said and done, you could execute the intent by doing something
    like:

    .. code-block:: none

        Alexa, ask Recipe Manager what do I need to cook Chocolate Chip Cookies

    Having one intent in your Alexa Skill is no fun, so let's create another
    intent with its own set of sample phrases. Choose to create a new intent
    titled ``GetRecipeFromIngredientsIntent`` with the following sample
    utterances:

    .. code-block:: none

        what can i cook with {ingredientone} and {ingredienttwo}
        what are some recipes with {ingredientone} and {ingredienttwo}
        if i have {ingredientone} and {ingredienttwo} what can i cook

    This time around we're using two slot variables instead of one. Like
    previously mentioned, it is probably a good idea to add significantly
    more sample utterances to get the best results. Alexa needs to be able
    to process the data to send to your Lambda function.

    At this point in time, the configuration in the Alexa Developer Portal
    is about complete. The exception being the endpoint which doesn't exist
    yet.

    Building a Lambda Function with Golang and MongoDB
    --------------------------------------------------

    Alexa, for the most part should be able to direct requests, so now we
    need to create our backend to receive and process them. This is where
    Lambda, Go, and MongoDB come into play.

    Assuming Golang has been properly installed and configured, create a new
    project within your **$GOPATH** and within that project, create a
    **main.go** file. As boilerplate to get the ball rolling, this file
    should contain the following:

    .. code-block:: go

        package main

        func main() { }

    With the boilerplate code added, now we can install the MongoDB Go
    driver. To do this, you could in theory do a ``go get``, but the
    preferred approach as of now is to use the
    `dep <https://github.com/golang/dep>`__ package management tool for
    Golang. To do this, after having installed the tool, execute the
    following:

    .. code-block:: bash

        dep init
        dep ensure -add "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"

    We're using ``dep`` so that way the version of the driver that we're
    using in our project is version locked.

    In addition to the MongoDB Go driver, we're also going to need to get
    the `AWS Lambda SDK for Go <https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go>`__ as
    well as an `unofficial SDK for
    Alexa <https://github.com/arienmalec/alexa-go>`__, since no official SDK
    exists. To do this, we can execute:

    .. code-block:: bash

        dep ensure -add "github.com/arienmalec/alexa-go"
        dep ensure -add "github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"

    With the dependencies available to us, we can modify the project's
    **main.go** file. Open the file and add the following code:

    .. code-block:: go

        package main

        import (
            "context"
            "os"

            "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
            "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options"
        )

        // Stores a handle to the collection being used by the Lambda function
        type Connection struct {
            collection *mongo.Collection
        }

        func main() {
            ctx := context.Background()
            client, err := mongo.Connect(ctx, options.Client().ApplyURI(os.Getenv("ATLAS_URI")))
            if err != nil {
                panic(err)
            }

            defer client.Disconnect(ctx)

            connection := Connection{
                collection: client.Database("alexa").Collection("recipes"),
            }
        }

    In the ``main`` function we are creating a client using the connection
    string of our cluster. In this case, I'm using an environment variable
    on my computer that points to my MongoDB Atlas cluster. Feel free to
    configure that connection string however you feel the most confident.

    Upon connecting, we are getting a handle of a ``recipes`` collection for
    an ``alexa`` database and storing it in a ``Connection`` data structure.
    Because we won't be writing any data in this example, both the ``alexa``
    database and the ``recipes`` collection should exist prior to running
    this application.

    You can check out more information about connecting to MongoDB with the
    Go programming language in a `previous
    tutorial <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/quick-start-golang--mongodb--starting-and-setup>`__
    I wrote.

    So why are we storing the collection handle in a ``Connection`` data
    structure?

    AWS Lambda behaves a little differently when it comes to web
    applications. Instead of running the ``main`` function and then
    remaining alive for as long as your server remains alive, Lambda
    functions tend to suspend or shutdown when they are not used. For this
    reason, we cannot rely on our connection being available and we also
    don't want to establish too many connections to our database in the
    scenario where our function hasn't shut down. To handle this, we can
    pass the connection from our ``main`` function to our logic function.

    Let's make a change to see this in action:

    .. code-block:: go

        package main

        import (
            "context"
            "os"

            "github.com/arienmalec/alexa-go"
            "github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
            "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
            "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options"
        )

        // Stores a handle to the collection being used by the Lambda function
        type Connection struct {
            collection *mongo.Collection
        }

        func (connection Connection) IntentDispatcher(ctx context.Context, request alexa.Request) (alexa.Response, error) {
            // Alexa logic here...
        }

        func main() {
            ctx := context.Background()
            client, err := mongo.Connect(ctx, options.Client().ApplyURI(os.Getenv("ATLAS_URI")))
            if err != nil {
                panic(err)
            }

            defer client.Disconnect(ctx)

            connection := Connection{
                collection: client.Database("alexa").Collection("recipes"),
            }

            lambda.Start(connection.IntentDispatcher)
        }

    Notice in the above code that we've added a ``lambda.Start`` call in our
    ``main`` function that points to an ``IntentDispatcher`` function. We're
    designing this function to use the connection information established in
    the ``main`` function, which based on our Lambda knowledge, may not run
    every time the function is executed.

    So we've got the foundation to our Alexa Skill in place. Now we need to
    design the logic for each of our intents that were previously defined in
    the Alexa Developer Portal.

    Since this is going to be a recipe related Skill, let's model our
    MongoDB documents like the following:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "_id": ObjectID("234232358943"),
            "name": "chocolate chip cookies",
            "ingredients": [
                "flour",
                "egg",
                "sugar",
                "chocolate"
            ]
        }

    There is no doubt that our documents could be more extravagant, but for
    this example it will work out fine. Within the MongoDB Atlas cluster,
    create the **alexa** database if it doesn't already exist and add a
    document modeled like the above in a **recipes** collection.

    In the ``main.go`` file of the project, add the following data
    structure:

    .. code-block:: go

        // A data structure representation of the collection schema
        type Recipe struct {
            ID          primitive.ObjectID `bson:"_id"`
            Name        string             `bson:"name"`
            Ingredients []string           `bson:"ingredients"`
        }

    With the MongoDB Go driver, we can annotate Go data structures with BSON
    so that way we can easily map between the two. It essentially makes our
    lives a lot easier when working with MongoDB and Go.

    Let's circle back to the ``IntentDispatcher`` function:

    .. code-block:: go

        func (connection Connection) IntentDispatcher(ctx context.Context, request alexa.Request) (alexa.Response, error) {
            var response alexa.Response
            switch request.Body.Intent.Name {
            case "GetIngredientsForRecipeIntent":
            case "GetRecipeFromIngredientsIntent":
            default:
                response = alexa.NewSimpleResponse("Unknown Request", "The intent was unrecognized")
            }
            return response, nil
        }

    Remember the two intents from the Alexa Developer Portal? We need to
    assign logic to them.

    Essentially, we're going to do some database logic and then use the
    ``NewSimpleResponse`` function to create a response the the results.

    Let's start with the ``GetIngredientsForRecipeIntent`` logic:

    .. code-block:: go

        case "GetIngredientsForRecipeIntent":
            var recipe Recipe
            recipeName := request.Body.Intent.Slots["recipe"].Value
            if recipeName == "" {
                return alexa.Response{}, errors.New("Recipe name is not present in the request")
            }
            if err := connection.collection.FindOne(ctx, bson.M{"name": recipeName}).Decode(&recipe); err != nil {
                return alexa.Response{}, err
            }
            response = alexa.NewSimpleResponse("Ingredients", strings.Join(recipe.Ingredients, ", "))

    In the above snippet, we are getting the slot variable that was passed
    and are issuing a ``FindOne`` query against the collection. The filter
    for the query says that the ``name`` field of the document must match
    the recipe that was passed in as a slot variable.

    If there was a match, we are serializing the array of ingredients into a
    string and are returning it back to Alexa. In theory, Alexa should then
    read back the comma separated list of ingredients.

    Now let's take a look at the ``GetRecipeFromIngredientsIntent`` intent
    logic:

    .. code-block:: go

        case "GetRecipeFromIngredientsIntent":
            var recipes []Recipe
            ingredient1 := request.Body.Intent.Slots["ingredientone"].Value
            ingredient2 := request.Body.Intent.Slots["ingredienttwo"].Value
            cursor, err := connection.collection.Find(ctx, bson.M{
                "ingredients": bson.D{
                    {"$all", bson.A{ingredient1, ingredient2}},
                },
            })
            if err != nil {
                return alexa.Response{}, err
            }
            if err = cursor.All(ctx, &recipes); err != nil {
                return alexa.Response{}, err
            }
            var recipeList []string
            for _, recipe := range recipes {
                recipeList = append(recipeList, recipe.Name)
            }
            response = alexa.NewSimpleResponse("Recipes", strings.Join(recipeList, ", "))

    In the above snippet, we are taking both slot variables that represent
    ingredients and are using them in a ``Find`` query on the collection.
    This time around we are using the ``$all`` operator because we want to
    filter for all recipes that contain both ingredients anywhere in the
    array.

    With the results of the ``Find``, we can create create an array of the
    recipe names and serialize it to a string to be returned as part of the
    Alexa response.

    If you'd like more information on the ``Find`` and ``FindOne`` commands
    for Go and MongoDB, check out my `how to read documents
    tutorial <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/quick-start-golang--mongodb--how-to-read-documents>`__
    on the subject.

    While it might seem simple, the code for the Alexa Skill is actually
    complete. We've coded scenarios for each of the two intents that we've
    set up in the Alexa Developer Portal. We could improve upon what we've
    done or create more intents, but it is out of the scope of what we want
    to accomplish.

    Now that we have our application, we need to build it for Lambda.

    Execute the following commands:

    .. code-block:: bash

        GOOS=linux go build
        zip handler.zip ./project-name

    So what's happening in the above commands? First we are building a Linux
    compatible binary. We're doing this because if you're developing on Mac
    or Windows, you're going to end up with a binary that is incompatible.
    By defining the operating system, we're telling Go what to build for.

    For more information on cross-compiling with Go, check out my
    `Cross Compiling Golang Applications For Use On A Raspberry Pi
    <https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/04/cross-compiling-golang-applications-raspberry-pi/>`__
    post.

    Next, we are creating an archive of our binary. It is important to
    replace the ``project-name`` with that of your actual binary name. It is
    important to remember the name of the file as it is used in the Lambda
    dashboard.

    .. figure:: /images/how-to/amazon-lambda-portal-635pa2aya3.jpg
        :alt: Amazon Lambda Dashboard

    When you choose to create a new Lambda function within AWS, make sure Go
    is the development technology. Choose to upload the ZIP file and add the
    name of the binary as the handler.

    Now it comes down to linking Alexa with Lambda.

    Take note of the **ARN** value of your Lambda function. This will be
    added in the Alexa Portal. Also, make sure you add the Alexa Skills Kit
    as a trigger to the function. It is as simple as selecting it from the
    list.

    Navigate back to the `Alexa Developer
    Portal <https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask>`__ and choose
    the **Endpoint** checklist item. Add the ARN value to the default region
    and choose to build the Skill using the **Build Model** button.

    When the Skill is done building, you can test it using the simulator
    that Amazon offers as part of the Alexa Developer Portal. This simulator
    can be accessed using the **Test** tab within the portal.

    If you've used the same sample utterances that I have, you can try
    entering something like this:

    .. code-block:: none

        ask recipe manager what can i cook with flour and sugar
        ask recipe manager what chocolate chip cookies requires

    Of course the assumption is that you also have collection entries for
    chocolate chip cookies and the various ingredients that I used above.
    Feel free to modify the variable terms with those of your own data.

    Conclusion
    ----------

    You just saw how to build an Alexa Skill with
    `MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.com>`__, Golang, and AWS Lambda. Knowing
    how to develop applications for voice assistants like Alexa is great
    because they are becoming increasingly popular, and the good news is
    that they aren't any more difficult than writing standard applications.

    As previously mentioned, MongoDB Atlas makes pairing MongoDB with Lambda
    and Alexa very convenient. You can use the free tier or upgrade to
    something better with some promotional credits using coupon NICRABOY200.

    If you'd like to expand your Alexa with Go knowledge and get more
    practice, check out a previous tutorial I wrote titled `Build an Alexa
    Skill with Golang and AWS
