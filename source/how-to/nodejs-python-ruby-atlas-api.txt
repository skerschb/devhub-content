Calling the MongoDB Atlas API - How to do it from Node, Python, and Ruby
========================================================================

.. content::

   The real power of a cloud-hosted, fully managed service like `MongoDB
   Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ is that you can create
   whole new database deployment architectures automatically, using the
   services API. Getting to the `MongoDB Atlas
   API <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/api/>`__ is relatively simple and,
   once unlocked, it opens up a massive opportunity to integrate and
   automate the management of database deployments from creation to
   deletion. The API itself is an extensive REST API, there's role-based
   access control and you can have `user or app-specific
   credentials <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-api-access/>`__ to
   access it.

   There is one tiny thing that can trip people up though. The credentials
   have to be passed over using the digest authentication mechanism, not
   the more common basic authentication or using an issued token. Digest
   authentication, at its simplest, waits to get an HTTP 401 (not
   authorized) from the web endpoint. That response comes with data and the
   client then sends an encrypted form of the username and password as a
   digest and the server works with that.

   And that's why we are here today, to show you how to do that with the
   least fuss in Python, Node, and Ruby. In each example, we'll try and
   access the base URL of the Atlas API which returns a JSON document about
   the underlying applications name, build and other facts.

   Python
   ------

   We start with the simplest and most self-contained example, Python.

   .. code-block:: python

      import os
      import requests
      from requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth
      import pprint

      baseurl = "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v1.0/"

      response=requests.get(baseurl, auth=HTTPDigestAuth(
         os.environ["ATLAS_USER"], os.environ["ATLAS_USER_KEY"]))

      pprint.pprint(response.json())

   In the Python version, we lean on the ``requests`` library for most of
   the heavy lifting. As well as importing ``requests`` we also bring in
   ``HTTPDigestAuth`` from requests' ``auth`` module to handle digest
   authentication. The ``os`` import is just there so we can get the
   environment variables ``ATLAS_USER`` and ``ATLAS_USER_KEY`` as
   credentials and the ``pprint`` import is just to format our results.

   The critical part is the addition of ``auth=HTTPDigestAuth(...)`` to the
   ``requests.get()`` call. This installs the code needed to respond to the
   server when it asks for the digest.

   If we now run this program…

   We have our API response.

   Node.js
   -------

   For Node.js, it is a matter of finding a package which does HTTP
   fetching with digest authentication. There's a whole ecosystem of
   packages out there and one that we found that worked was
   `digest-fetch <https://www.npmjs.com/package/digest-fetch>`__ which
   wraps the very popular
   `node-fetch <https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch>`__ library with
   what it needs to do HTTP Digest authentication. After installing the
   required libraries

   .. code-block:: auto

      npm install digest-fetch crypto-js node-fetch --save

   We can now create our code:

   .. code-block:: auto

      const DigestFetch = require("digest-fetch");

      const client = new DigestFetch(
      process.env.ATLAS_USER,
      process.env.ATLAS_USER_KEY,
      { }
      );

      const urlbase = "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v1.0/";

      client
      .fetch(urlbase,{})
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => console.log(JSON.stringify(json,null," ")));

   Taking it from the top… We first require and import the digest-fetch
   package. It'll pull in the other needed packages. Then we create our
   DigestFetch client, giving it the user and key values from the
   environment and an empty set of options. After setting the API's URL
   base value we then processed to ``client.fetch()`` from it. We're using
   promises and so the next two ``thens`` see the data converted to JSON
   and then pretty-printed on the console. And we're ready to run:

   On to our final language…

   Ruby
   ----

   HTTParty is a widely used Gem which is used by the Ruby and Rails
   community to perform HTTP operations. It also, luckily, supports digest
   authentication so, first up, ``gem install httparty`` to get the party
   started. There are two ways to use HTTParty, one is creating an object
   which abstracts the calls away while the other is just directly calling
   methods on HTTParty itself. For brevity, we'll do the latter. Here's the
   code:

   .. code-block:: auto

      require 'httparty'
      require 'json'

      auth={:username=>ENV['ATLAS_USER'],:password=>ENV['ATLAS_USER_KEY']}
      baseurl='https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v1.0/'

      result=HTTParty.get(baseurl,  { :digest_auth => auth } )

      pp JSON.parse(result.body())

   We require in the HTTParty and json gems first. We then create a
   dictionary with our username and key, mapped for HTTParty's
   authentication and set a variable to hold the base URL. We're ready to
   do our get now, and in the options - the second parameter of the get -
   we pass ``:digest_auth=>auth`` to switch on the digest support. We wrap
   up by JSON parsing the resulting body and pretty printing that. Put it
   all together and run it and we get:

   Next Stop - The API
   -------------------

   With the authentication taken care of - just remember to be fastidious
   with your API key security and make sure you revoke unused keys - you
   can now move on to explore the API itself. Start in the
   `documentation <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/api/>`__ and see what you
   can automate today.
