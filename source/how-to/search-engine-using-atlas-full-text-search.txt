Tutorial: Build a Movie Search Engine Using Atlas Full-Text Search in 10 Minutes
================================================================================

.. introduction::
      
   .. blockquote::

      Atlas Full-Text Search is now `Atlas
      Search <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/search>`__.

   Giving your users the ability to find exactly what they are looking for
   in your application is critical for a fantastic user experience. With
   the new `MongoDB Atlas Full-Text
   Search <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/full-text-search>`__ service, we
   have made it easier than ever to integrate simple yet sophisticated
   search capabilities into your MongoDB applications. To demonstrate just
   how easy it is, let's build a movie search engine - in only 10 minutes.

   Built on Apache Lucene, Full-Text Search adds document data to a
   full-text search index to make that data searchable in a highly
   performant, scalable manner. This tutorial will guide you through how to
   build a web application to search for movies based on a topic using
   Atlas' sample movie data collection on a free tier cluster. We will
   create a Full-Text Search index on that sample data. Then we will query
   on this index to filter, rank and sort through those movies to quickly
   surface movies by topic.

      :align: center

.. prerequisites::

   Armed with a basic knowledge of HTML and Javascript, here are the tasks
   we will accomplish:

   -  ☐ Spin up an Atlas cluster and load sample movie data
   -  ☐ Create a Full-Text Search index in movie data collection
   -  ☐ Write an aggregation pipeline with $searchBeta operator
   -  ☐ Create a RESTful API to access data
   -  ☐ Call from the front end

   To **Get Started**, we will need:

   1. A free tier (M0) cluster on MongoDB Atlas. Click here to sign up for
      an account and deploy your free cluster on your preferred cloud
      provider and region.

      .. blockquote::

         **SPECIAL OFFER:**
         Want to try our Full-Text Search on a cluster of your own?
         ``YouOldMaid100`` for $100 of Atlas credit. For information on
         redeeming Atlas credit, see `Atlas

   2. The Atlas sample dataset loaded into your cluster. You can load the
      sample dataset by clicking the ellipse button and **Load Sample
      Dataset**.

      .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/load_sample_data.png
         :alt: Load Sample Dataset
         :align: center
   
      .. blockquote::
         For more detailed information on how to spin up a cluster, configure
         your IP address, create a user, and load sample data, check
         out `Getting Started with MongoDB
         Atlas <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/#atlas-getting-started>`__ from
         our documentation.

   3. (Optional) MongoDB Compass. This is the free GUI for MongoDB that
      allows you to make smarter decisions about document structure,
      querying, indexing, document validation, and more. The latest version
      can be found here `https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass>`__.

   Once your sample dataset is loaded into your database, let's have a
   closer look to see what we are working within the Atlas Data Explorer.
   In your Atlas UI, click on **Collections** to examine the ``movies``
   collection in the new ``sample_mflix`` database. This collection has
   over 23k movie documents with information such as title, plot, and cast.

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/fts_demo.png
      :alt: "Sample dataset"
      :align: center


   -  ☒ Spin up an Atlas cluster and load sample movie data
   -  ☐ Create a Full-Text Search index in movie data collection
   -  ☐ Write an aggregation pipeline with $searchBeta operator
   -  ☐ Create a RESTful API to access data
   -  ☐ Call from the front end

   Create a Full-Text Search Index
   -------------------------------

   Our movie search engine is going to look for movies based on a topic. We
   will use Full-Text Search to query for specific words and phrases in the
   'fullplot' field.

   The first thing we need is a Full-Text Search index. Click on the tab
   titled SearchBETA under **Collections**. Clicking on the green **Create
   a Search Index** button will open a dialog that looks like this:

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/build-search-index-atlas-modal-screenshot.png
      :alt: Create Full Text Search Index
      :align: center

   By default, we dynamically map all the text fields in your collection.
   This suits MongoDB's flexible data model perfectly. As you add new data
   to your collection and your schema evolves, dynamic mapping accommodates
   those changes in your schema and adds that new data to the Full-Text
   Search index automatically.

   Let's accept the default settings and click **Create Index**. *And
   that's all you need to do to start taking advantage of Lucene in your
   MongoDB Atlas data!*

   -  ☒ Spin up an Atlas cluster and load sample movie data
   -  ☒ Create a Full-Text Search index in movie data collection
   -  ☐ Write an aggregation pipeline with $searchBeta operator
   -  ☐ Create a RESTful API to access data
   -  ☐ Call from the front end

   Write Aggregation Pipeline With $searchbeta Operator
   ----------------------------------------------------

   Full-Text Search queries take the form of an `aggregation pipeline
   stage <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/>`__. The
   **$searchBeta** stage performs a search query on the specified field(s)
   covered by the Full-Text Search index and must be used as the first
   stage in the aggregation pipeline.

   Let's use MongoDB Compass to see an aggregation pipeline that makes use
   of this Full-Text Search index. For instructions on how to connect your
   Atlas cluster to MongoDB Compass, `click
   here <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/compass-connection/index.html>`__.

   *You do not have to use Compass for this stage, but I really love the
   easy-to-use UI Compass has to offer. Plus the ability to preview the
   results by stage makes troubleshooting a snap! For more on Compass'
   Aggregation Pipeline Builder, check out
   this*\ `blog <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/introducing-the-aggregation-pipeline-builder-in-mongodb-compass>`__\ *.*

   Navigate to the Aggregations tab in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection:

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/aggregations-tab.png
      :alt: Aggregations tab
      :align: center

   Stage 1. $searchBeta
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/searchBeta.png
      :alt: "Search Beta"
      :align: center

   For the first stage, select the **$searchBeta** aggregation operator to
   search for the terms 'werewolves and vampires' in the ``fullplot``
   field.

   Using the **highlight** option will return the highlights by adding
   fields to the result that display search terms in their original
   context, along with the adjacent text content. (More on this later.)

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/searchBeta2.png
      :alt: "Extended Search"
      :align: center

   .. blockquote::

      Note the returned movie documents in the preview panel on the right.
      If no documents are in the panel, double-check the formatting in your
      aggregation code.

   Stage 2: $project
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/project.png
      :alt: "Project dialog"
      :align: center

   We use ``$project`` to get back only the fields we will use in
   our movie search application. We also use the ``$meta``
   operator to surface each document's **searchScore** and
   **searchHighlights** in the result set.

   Let's break down the individual pieces in this stage further:

   **SCORE:** The ``"$meta": "searchScore"`` contains the assigned score
   for the document based on relevance. This signifies how well this
   movie's ``fullplot`` field matches the query terms 'werewolves and
   vampires' above.

   Note that by scrolling in the right preview panel, the movie documents
   are returned with the score in descending order so that the best matches
   are provided first.

   **HIGHLIGHT:** The **"$meta": "searchHighlights"** contains the
   highlighted results.

   *Because*\ **searchHighlights**\ *and*\ **searchScore**\ *are not part
   of the original document, it is necessary to use a $project pipeline
   stage to add them to the query output.*

   Now open a document's **highlight** array to show the data objects with
   text **values** and **types**.

   .. code-block:: bash

      title:"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"
      fullplot:"Set in contemporary New York City, a seemingly ordinary teenager, Clar..."
      year:2013
      score:6.849891185760498
      highlight:Array
          0:Object
              path:"fullplot"
              texts:Array
                  0:Object
                      value:"After the disappearance of her mother, Clary must join forces with a g..."
                      type:"text"
                  1:Object
                      value:"vampires"
                      type:"hit"
                  2:Object
                  3:Object
                  4:Object
                  5:Object
                  6:Object
              score:3.556248188018799

   **highlight.texts.value** - text from the ``fullplot`` field, which
   returned a match. **highlight.texts.type** - either a hit or a text. A
   hit is a match for the query, whereas a **text** is text content
   adjacent to the matching string. We will use these later in our
   application code.

   Stage 3: $limit
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/limit.png
      :alt: "limit"
      :align: center

   Remember the results are returned with the scores in descending order,
   so $limit: 10 will bring the 10 most relevant movie documents to your
   search query.

   Finally, if you see results in the right preview panel, your aggregation
   pipeline is working properly! Let's grab that aggregation code with
   Compass' Export Pipeline to Language feature by clicking the button in
   the top toolbar.

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/pipeline-export.png
      :alt: Export aggregation pipeline
      :align: center

   Your final aggregation code will be this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      [
          { $searchBeta: {
      search: {
            query: 'werewolves and vampires',
            path: 'fullplot' },
       highlight: {  path: 'fullplot' }
                     }},
                     { $project: {
       title: 1,
       _id: 0,
       year: 1,
       fullplot: 1,
       score: { $meta: 'searchScore' },
       highlight: { $meta: 'searchHighlights' }
                      }},
                      { $limit: 10 }
      ]

   -  ☒ Spin up an Atlas cluster and load sample movie data
   -  ☒ Create a Full-Text Search index in movie data collection
   -  ☒ Write an aggregation pipeline with $searchBeta operator
   -  ☐ Create a RESTful API to access data
   -  ☐ Call from the front end


   Create a REST API
   -----------------

   Now that we have the heart of our movie search engine in the form of an
   aggregation pipeline, how will we use it in an application? There are
   lots of ways to do this, but I found the easiest was to simply create a
   RESTful API to expose this data - and for that, I used MongoDB Stitch's
   HTTP Service.

   `Stitch <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/stitch>`__ is MongoDB's
   serverless platform where functions written in Javascript automatically
   scale to meet current demand. To create a Stitch application, return to
   your Atlas UI and click **Stitch** under SERVICES on the left menu, then
   click the green **Create New Application** button.

   Name your Stitch application FTSDemo and make sure to link to your M0
   cluster. All other default settings are fine:

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/create-new-stitch-application.png
      :alt: Create a new Stitch Application
      :align: center

   Now click the **3rd Party Services** menu on the left and then **Add a
   Service**. Select the HTTP service and name it **movies**:

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/add-a-service.png
      :alt: Add a Service
      :align: center

   Click the green **Add a Service** button, and you'll be directed to add
   an incoming webhook.

   Once in the **Settings** tab, enable **Respond with Result**, set the
   HTTP Method to **GET**, and to make things simple, let's just run the
   webhook as the System and skip validation.

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/add-a-webhook.png
      :alt: Webhook
      :align: center

   In this service function editor, replace the example code with the
   following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      exports = function(payload) {
        const collection =             context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("sample_mflix").collection("movies");
        let arg = payload.query.arg;
        return collection.aggregate([
            { $searchBeta: {
                           search: {
                              query: arg,
                              path:'fullplot',
                            },
                            highlight: { path: 'fullplot' }
                    }},
                    { $project: {
                           title: 1,
                           _id:0,
                           year:1,
                           fullplot:1,
                           score: { $meta: 'searchScore'},
                           highlight: {$meta: 'searchHighlights'}
                    }},
                    { $limit: 10}
            ]).toArray();
      };

   Let's break down some of these components. MongoDB Stitch interacts with
   your Atlas movies collection through the global **context** variable. In
   the service function, we use that context variable to access the
   sample_mflix.movies collection in your Atlas cluster:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      const collection =
      context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("sample_mflix").collection("movies");

   We capture the query argument from the payload:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      let arg = payload.query.arg;

   Return the aggregation code executed on the collection by pasting your
   aggregation into the code below:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      return collection.aggregate(<<PASTE AGGREGATION PIPELINE HERE>>).toArray();

   Finally, after pasting the aggregation code, we changed the terms
   'werewolves and vampires' to the generic arg to match the function's
   payload query argument - otherwise our movie search engine capabilities
   will be extremely limited.

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/query-code.gif
      :alt: Query code
      :align: center

   Now you can test in the Console below the editor by changing the
   argument from **arg1: "hello"** to **arg: "werewolves and vampires"**.

   .. blockquote::

      Note: Please be sure to change BOTH the field name **arg1** to
      **arg**, as well as the string value **"hello"** to **"werewolves and
      vampires"** - or it won't work.

   Click **Run** to verify the result:

   If this is working, congrats! We are almost done! Make sure to **SAVE**
   and deploy the service by clicking **REVIEW & DEPLOY CHANGES** at the
   top of the screen.

   Use the API
   ~~~~~~~~~~~

   The beauty of a REST API is that it can be called from just about
   anywhere. Let's execute it in our browser. However, if you have tools
   like Postman installed, feel free to try that as well.

   Switch to the **Settings** tab of the **movies** service in Stitch and
   you'll notice a Webhook URL has been generated.

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/webhook-url.jpg
      :alt: Webhook URL
      :align: center

   Click the **COPY** button and paste the URL into your browser. Then
   append the following to the end of your URL: **?arg='werewolves and
   vampires'**

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/query-output.png
      :alt: Query output
      :align: center

   If you receive an output like what we have above, congratulations! You
   have successfully created a movie search API!

   -  ☒ Create a RESTful API to access data
   -  ☐ Call from the front end


   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/almost-there.gif
      :alt: Almost there
      :align: center

   Finally! – The Front End
   ------------------------

   From the front end application, it takes a single call from the Fetch
   API to retrieve this data. Download the following `index.html
   file <https://developer-advocacy-public.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/full-text-search-demo/index.html>`__
   and open it in your browser. You will see a simple search bar:

   .. image:: /images/atlas-fts/search-bar.png
      :alt: Search Bar
      :align: center

   Entering data in the search bar will bring you movie search results
   because the application is currently pointing to an existing API.

   Now open the HTML file with your favorite text editor and familiarize
   yourself with the contents. You'll note this contains a very simple container and two javascript functions:

   -  Line 82 - **userAction()** will execute when the user enters a
      search. If there is valid input in the search box and no errors, we
      will call the **buildMovieList()** function.
   -  Line 125 - **buildMovieList()** is a helper function for
      **userAction()** which will build out the list of movies, along with
      their scores and highlights from the 'fullplot' field. Notice in line
      146 that if the highlight.texts.type === "hit" we highlight the
      highlight.texts.value with the tag.

   Modify the Front End Code to Use Your API
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In the **userAction()** function, we take the input from the search form
   field in line 79 and set it equal to **searchString**. Notice on line 82
   that the **webhook_url** is already set to a RESTful API I created in my
   own FTSDemo application. In this application, we append that
   **searchString** input to the **webhook_url** before calling it in the
   fetch API in line 111. To make this application fully your own, simply
   replace the existing **webhook_url** value on line 82 with your own API
   from the **movies** Stitch HTTP Service you just created. 🤞

   Now save these changes, and open the **index.html** file once more in
   your browser, et voilà! You have just built your movie search engine
   using Full-Text search indexes. 🙌 What kind of movie do you want to
   watch?!
