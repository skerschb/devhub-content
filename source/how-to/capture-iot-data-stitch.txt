Capture IOT Data With MongoDB Stitch in 5 Minutes
=================================================

.. content::

  Capturing IOT data is a complex task for 2 main reasons:
  
  - We have to deal with a huge amount of data so we need a rock solid architecture.
  - While keeping a bulletproof security level.

  First, let's have a look at a standard IOT capture architecture:

  .. image:: /images/how-to/iot_00-bstfa0fkxb.png

  On the left, we have our sensors. Let's assume they can push data every
  second over TCP using a
  `POST <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)>`__ and let's suppose
  we have a million of them. We need an architecture capable to handle a
  million queries per seconds and able to resist any kind of network or
  hardware failure. TCP queries need to be distributed evenly to the
  application servers using `load
  balancers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)>`__
  and finally, the application servers are able to push the data to our
  multiple
  `Mongos <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/>`__
  routers from our `MongoDB Sharded
  Cluster <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/>`__.

  As you can see, this architecture is relatively complex to install. We need to:

  - buy and maintain a lot of servers,
  - make security updates on a regular basis of the Operating Systems
    and applications,
  - have an auto-scaling capability (reduce maintenance cost & enable
    automatic failover)…

  This kind of architecture is expensive and maintenance cost can be quite
  high as well.

  Now let's solve this same problem with MongoDB Stitch!

  .. image:: /images/how-to/Iot_01-xs1xezu0vb.png

  Once you have created a `MongoDB Atlas
  cluster <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpA2FIn761U>`__, you can attach
  a `MongoDB Stitch <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/stitch>`__ application
  to it and then create an `HTTP
  Service <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/reference/service-webhooks/>`__
  containing the following code:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    exports = function(payload, response) {
      const mongodb = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas");
      const sensors = mongodb.db("stitch").collection("sensors");
      var body = EJSON.parse(payload.body.text());
      body.createdAt = new Date();
      sensors.insertOne(body)
      .then(result => {
        response.setStatusCode(201);
      });
    };

  And that's it! That's all we need! Our HTTP POST service can be reached
  directly by the sensors from the webhook provided by MongoDB Stitch like
  so:

  .. code-block:: auto

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"temp":22.4}' https://webhooks.mongodb-stitch.com/api/client/v2.0/app/stitchtapp-abcde/service/sensors/incoming_webhook/post_sensor?secret=test

  Because MongoDB Stitch is capable of scaling automatically according to
  demand, you no longer have to take care of infrastructure or handling
  failovers.

  Thanks for taking the time to read my post. I hope you found it useful
  and interesting.

  If you are looking for a very simple way to get started with MongoDB,
  you can do that in just 5 clicks on our `MongoDB
  Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ database service in the
  cloud.

  You can also try `MongoDB Stitch for
  free <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/stitch>`__ and discover `how the
  billing works <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/admin/billing/>`__.

  If you want to query your data sitting in MongoDB Atlas using MongoDB
  Stitch, I recommend `this article from Michael
  Lynn <https://medium.com/@michael.lynn/creating-a-data-enabled-api-in-10-minutes-with-mongodb-stitch-6d23578fed6d>`__.
