Building with Patterns: The Bucket Pattern
==========================================

.. introduction::

   In this edition of the *Building with Patterns* series, we’re going to
   cover the Bucket Pattern. This pattern is particularly effective when
   working with Internet of Things (IoT), Real-Time Analytics, or
   Time-Series data in general. By *bucketing* data together we make it
   easier to organize specific groups of data, increasing the ability to
   discover historical trends or provide future forecasting and optimize
   our use of storage.

   The Bucket Pattern
   ------------------

   With data coming in as a stream over a period of time (time series data)
   we may be inclined to store each measurement in its own document.
   However, this inclination is a very relational approach to handling the
   data. If we have a sensor taking the temperature and saving it to the
   database every minute, our data stream might look something like:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         sensor_id: 12345,
         timestamp: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:00:00.000Z"),
         temperature: 40
      }

      {
         sensor_id: 12345,
         timestamp: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:01:00.000Z"),
         temperature: 40
      }

      {
         sensor_id: 12345,
         timestamp: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:02:00.000Z"),
         temperature: 41
      }

   This can pose some issues as our application scales in terms of data and
   index size. For example, we could end up having to index ``sensor_id``
   and ``timestamp`` for every single measurement to enable rapid access at
   the cost of RAM. By leveraging the document data model though, we can
   “bucket” this data, by time, into documents that hold the measurements
   from a particular time span. We can also programmatically add additional
   information to each of these “buckets”.

   By applying the Bucket Pattern to our data model, we get some benefits
   in terms of index size savings, potential query simplification, and the
   ability to use that pre-aggregated data in our documents. Taking the
   data stream from above and applying the Bucket Pattern to it, we would
   wind up with:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
          sensor_id: 12345,
          start_date: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:00:00.000Z"),
          end_date: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:59:59.000Z"),
          measurements: [
             {
             timestamp: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:00:00.000Z"),
             temperature: 40
             },
             {
             timestamp: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:01:00.000Z"),
             temperature: 40
             },
             …
             {
             timestamp: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:42:00.000Z"),
             temperature: 42
             }
          ],
         transaction_count: 42,
         sum_temperature: 2413
      }

   By using the Bucket Pattern, we have “bucketed” our data to, in this
   case, a one hour bucket. This particular data stream would still be
   growing as it currently only has 42 measurements; there’s still more
   measurements for that hour to be added to the “bucket”. When they are
   added to the ``measurements`` array, the ``transaction_count`` will be
   incremented and ``sum_temperature`` will also be updated.

   With the pre-aggregated ``sum_temperature`` value, it then becomes
   possible to easily pull up a particular bucket and determine the average
   temperature (``sum_temperature / transaction_count``) for that bucket.
   When working with time-series data it is frequently more interesting and
   important to know what the average temperature was from 2:00 to 3:00 pm
   in Corning, California on 13 July 2018 than knowing what the temperature
   was at 2:03 pm. By bucketing and doing pre-aggregation we’re more able
   to easily provide that information.

   Additionally, as we gather more and more information we may determine
   that keeping all of the source data in an archive is more effective. How
   frequently do we need to access the temperature for Corning from 1948,
   for example? Being able to move those buckets of data to a data archive
   can be a large benefit.

   Sample Use Case
   ---------------

   One example of making time-series data valuable in the real world comes
   from an `IoT implementation by
   Bosch <https://www.mongodb.com/customers/bosch>`__. They are using
   MongoDB and time-series data in an automotive field data app. The app
   captures data from a variety of sensors throughout the vehicle allowing
   for improved diagnostics of the vehicle itself and component
   performance.

   Other examples include major banks that have incorporated this pattern
   in financial applications to group transactions together.

.. summary::

   Conclusion
   ----------

   When working with time-series data, using the Bucket Pattern in MongoDB
   is a great option. It reduces the overall number of documents in a
   collection, improves index performance, and by leveraging
   pre-aggregation, it can simplify data access.

   The Bucket Design pattern works great for many cases. But what if there
   are outliers in our data? That’s where the next pattern we’ll discuss,
   the :doc:`Outlier Design
   Pattern </how-to/outlier-pattern>`,
   comes into play.
