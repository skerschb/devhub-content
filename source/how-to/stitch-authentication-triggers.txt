MongoDB Stitch Authentication Triggers
======================================

   `MongoDB Stitch <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch>`__ makes it a breeze
   to use third-party services such as
   `Google <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/authentication/google/>`__ or
   `Facebook <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/authentication/facebook/>`__
   to authenticate your app's users. This is great for your users as it
   means they don't need to go through the tedious process of having to
   provide all of their details to yet another application/service – it
   also means one less password to remember.

   While delegating the authentication process makes your app secure and
   straightforward to use, you may still want to customize the process for
   your users. For example, if someone is registering for the first time,
   then you probably want to send them a welcome email. When a user
   deregisters, there may be regulations (such as
   `GDPR <https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/gdpr-impact-to-your-data-management-landscape>`__)
   that mandate you delete all of their data.

   This is where `Stitch Authentication
   Triggers <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/triggers/authentication-triggers/>`__
   come to the fore. The model is very simple; you register a `Stitch
   Function <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/functions/>`__ with any
   authentication event (register (create), login, deregister (delete)),
   then add JavaScript code to that function to perform the required
   actions.

   Simply create the trigger through the Stitch UI (in this case, to send
   the user an email every time they log in):

   and implement the function (``emailLoginNotification``) that receives
   the authentication event and sends the email using the AWS SES service:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      exports = function(event){
         var aws = context.services.get('AWS');
         var input = {
            Destination: {
               ToAddresses: [event.user.data.email]
            },
            Message: {
               Body: {
                  Html: {
                     Charset:"UTF-8",
                     Data:   "This is a message to confirm that "
                      + event.user.data.name
                      + " (" + event.user.data.email
                      + ") has just logged into TrackMe"
                  }
               },
               Subject: {
                     Charset:"UTF-8",
                     Data:   "TrackMe Login"
               }
            },
            Source: context.values.get('fromEmail')
         };
         try {
            aws.ses().SendEmail(input).then(function (result){
               console.log(JSON.stringify(result));
            });
         } catch(error) {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(error));
         }
      };
