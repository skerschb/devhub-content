MongoDB 3.6: Here to SRV you with easier replica set connections
================================================================

.. content::

    If you have logged into `MongoDB Atlas <http://bit.ly/meetatlas>`__
    recently – and you should, the entry-level tier is free! – you may have
    noticed a strange new syntax on 3.6 connection strings.

    .. figure:: /images/srv-address.png

    MongoDB Seed Lists
    ------------------

    What is this ``mongodb+srv`` syntax? 
    
    Well, in MongoDB 3.6 we
    introduced the concept of a `seed
    list <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/#dns-seedlist-connection-format>`__
    that is specified using DNS records, specifically
    `SRV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record>`__ and
    `TXT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record>`__ records. You will
    recall from using replica sets with MongoDB that the client must specify
    at least one replica set member (and may specify several of them) when
    connecting. This allows a client to connect to a replica set even if one
    of the nodes that the client specifies is unavailable. 
    
    
    You can see an
    example of this URL on a 3.4 cluster connection string:

    .. figure:: /images/connection-string.png

    Note that without the SRV record configuration we must list several
    nodes (in the case of Atlas we always include all the cluster members,
    though this is not required). We also have to specify the ``ssl`` and
    ``replicaSet`` options. 
    
    .. figure:: /images/connection-string.png
    
    With the 3.4 or earlier driver, we have
    to specify all the options on the command line using the `MongoDB URI
    syntax <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/>`__.
    
    The use of SRV records eliminates the requirement for every client to
    pass in a complete set of state information for the cluster. Instead, a
    single SRV record identifies all the nodes associated with the cluster
    (and their port numbers) and an associated TXT record defines the
    options for the URI.

    Reading SRV and TXT Records
    ---------------------------

    We can see how this works in practice on a MongoDB Atlas cluster with a
    simple Python script. 
    
    .. code-block:: python

       import srvlookup #pip install srvlookup
       import sys 
       import dns.resolver #pip install dnspython 
        
       host = None 
        
       if len(sys.argv) > 1 : 
          host = sys.argv[1] 
            
       if host : 
          services = srvlookup.lookup("mongodb", domain=host) 
          for i in services:
             print("%s:%i" % (i.hostname, i.port)) 
          for txtrecord in dns.resolver.query(host, 'TXT'): 
             print("%s: %s" % ( host, txtrecord))
        
       else: 
         print("No host specified") 
    
    We can run this script using the
    node specified in the 3.6 connection string as a parameter.

    .. code-block:: sh

       $ python mongodb_srv_records.py
       freeclusterjd-ffp4c.mongodb.net
       freeclusterjd-shard-00-00-ffp4c.mongodb.net:27017
       freeclusterjd-shard-00-01-ffp4c.mongodb.net:27017
       freeclusterjd-shard-00-02-ffp4c.mongodb.net:27017
       freeclusterjd-ffp4c.mongodb.net: "authSource=admin&replicaSet=FreeClusterJD-shard-0" 
       $ 
    
    You can also do this lookup with nslookup: 
    
    .. code-block:: sh

       JD10Gen-old:~ jdrumgoole$ nslookup
       > set type=SRV > \_mongodb._tcp.rs.joedrumgoole.com
       Server: 10.65.141.1
       Address: 10.65.141.1#53
        
       Non-authoritative answer:
       \_mongodb._tcp.rs.joedrumgoole.com  service = 0 0 27022 rs1.joedrumgoole.com.
       \_mongodb._tcp.rs.joedrumgoole.com  service = 0 0 27022 rs2.joedrumgoole.com.
       \_mongodb._tcp.rs.joedrumgoole.com  service = 0 0 27022 rs3.joedrumgoole.com.
        
       Authoritative answers can be found from:
       > set type=TXT
       > rs.joedrumgoole.com
       Server: 10.65.141.1
       Address: 10.65.141.1#53
        
       Non-authoritative answer:
       rs.joedrumgoole.com     text = "authSource=admin&replicaSet=srvdemo"
    
    You can see how this could
    be used to construct a 3.4 style connection string by comparing it with
    the 3.4 connection string above.
    
    As you can see, the
    complexity of the cluster and its configuration parameters are stored in
    the DNS server and hidden from the end user. If a node's IP address or
    name changes or we want to change the replica set name, this can all now
    be done completely transparently from the client's perspective. We can
    also add and remove nodes from a cluster without impacting clients. 
    
    So now whenever you see ``mongodb+srv`` you know you are expecting a
    SRV and TXT record to deliver the client connection string.

    Creating SRV and TXT records
    ----------------------------

    Of course, SRV and TXT records are not just for Atlas. You can also
    create your own SRV and TXT records for your self-hosted MongoDB
    clusters. All you need for this is edit access to your DNS server so you
    can add SRV and TXT records. In the examples that follow we are using
    the `AWS Route 53 DNS <https://aws.amazon.com/route53/>`__ service.
    
    I have set up a demo replica set on AWS with a three-node setup. They are

    .. code-block:: sh

       rs1.joedrumgoole.com 
       rs2.joedrumgoole.com 
       rs3.joedrumgoole.com
    
    Each has a mongod process running on port 27022. I have set up a
    security group that allows access to my local laptop and the nodes
    themselves so they can see each other. 
    
    I also set up the DNS names for
    the above nodes in AWS Route 53.

    .. figure:: /images/dnsnames.png

    We can start the mongod processes by running the following command on
    each node. 
    
    .. code-block:: sh

       $ sudo /usr/local/m/versions/3.6.3/bin/mongod --auth --port 27022 --replSet srvdemo --bind_ip 0.0.0.0 --keyFile mdb_keyfile"
    
    Now we need to set up the SRV and TXT records for this cluster.
    
    The SRV record points to the server or servers that will comprise the
    members of the replica set. The TXT record defines the options for the
    replica set, specifically the database that will be used for
    authorization and the name of the replica set. It is important to note
    that the **mongodb+srv** format URI implicitly adds "ssl=true". In our
    case SSL is not used for the demo so we have to append "&ssl=false" to
    the client connector. Note that the SRV record is specifically designed
    to look up the **mongodb** service referenced at the start of the URL.
    
    The settings in AWS Route 53 are: 

    .. figure:: /images/awsroutes.png

    Which leads to the following entry in the zone file for Route 53.

    .. figure:: /images/awsroutes2.png

    Now we can add the TXT record. By convention, we use the same name as
    the SRV record (``rs.joedrumgoole.com``) so that MongoDB knows where to
    find the TXT record. 
    
    We can do this on AWS Route 53 as follows:

    .. figure:: /images/awsroutes3.png

    This will create the following TXT record.

    .. figure:: /images/awsroutes4.png

    Now we can access this service as :

    .. code-block:: sh

       mongodb+srv://rs.joedrumgoole.com/test
        
    This will retrieve a complete
    URL and connection string which can then be used to contact the service.
    
    The whole process is outlined below:

    .. figure:: /images/srv-process.png

    Once your records are set up, you can easily change port numbers without
    impacting clients and also add and remove cluster members. 
    
    SRV records
    are another way in which MongoDB is making life easier for database
    developers everywhere.
