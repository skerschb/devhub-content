Mapping Terms and Concepts from SQL to MongoDB
===============================================
 
.. introduction::

   Perhaps, like me, you grew up on SQL databases. You can skillfully
   normalize a database, and, after years of working with tables, you 
   think in rows and columns as well.

   But now you’ve decided to dip your toe into the wonderful world of NoSQL
   databases, and you’re exploring MongoDB. Perhaps you’re wondering what
   you need to do differently. Can you just translate your rows and columns
   into fields and values and call it a day? Do you really need to change
   the way you think about storing your data?

   We’ll answer those questions and more in this three-part article series.
   Below is a summary of what we’ll cover today:

   Meet Ron
   --------

   I’m a huge fan of the best tv show ever created: Parks and Recreation.
   Yes, I wrote that previous sentence as if it were a fact, because it
   actually is.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/opinion.gif
      :alt: No.  That's your opinion.  That's the definition of an opinion.

   This is Ron. Ron likes strong women, bacon, and staying off the grid.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/bacon.gif
      :alt: When it comes to bacon, be prepared

   In season 6, Ron discovers `Yelp <https://www.yelp.com>`_. Ron thinks
   Yelp is amazing, because he loves the idea of reviewing places he’s
   been.

   However, Yelp is way too “on the grid” for Ron. He pulls out his beloved
   typewriter and starts typing reviews that he intends to send via snail
   mail.

   Ron writes some amazing reviews. Below is one of my favorites.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/yogurt1.gif
      :alt: Dear frozen yogurt,

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/yogurt2.gif
      :alt: You are the celery of desserts.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/yogurt3.gif
      :alt: Be ice cream or be nothing.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/yogurt4.gif
      :alt: Zero stars.           

   Unfortunately, I see three big problems with his plan: 
   
   #. Snail mail is
      way slower than posting the review to Yelp where it will be instantly
      available for anyone to read. 
   #. The business he is reviewing may never
      open the letter he sends as they may just assume it’s junk mail. 
   #. No one else will benefit from his review. (These are exactly the type of
      reviews I like to find on Amazon!)

   Why am I talking about Ron?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Ok, so why am I talking about Ron in the middle of
   this article about moving from SQL to MongoDB?

   Ron saw the value of Yelp and was inspired by the new technology.
   However, he brought his old-school ways with him and did not realize the
   full value of the technology.

   This is similar to what we commonly see as people move from a SQL
   database to a NoSQL database such as MongoDB. They love the idea of
   MongoDB, and they are inspired by the power of the flexible document
   data model. However, they frequently bring with them their SQL mindsets
   and don’t realize the full value of MongoDB. In fact, when people don’t
   change the way they think about modeling their data, they struggle and
   sometimes fail.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/trashcomputer.gif
      :alt: Ron throws computer in the trash 

   Don’t be like Ron. (At least in this case, because, in most cases, Ron
   is amazing.) Don’t be stuck in your SQL ways. Change your mindset and
   realize the full value of MongoDB.

   Before we jump into how to change your mindset, let’s begin by answering
   some common questions about non-relational databases and discussing the
   basics of how to store data in MongoDB.

   .. _sql-mdb-1-relational:

   Relational Database and Non-Relational Databases
   ------------------------------------------------

   When I talk with developers, they often ask me questions like, “What use
   cases are good for MongoDB?” Developers often have this feeling that
   `non-relational
   databases <https://www.mongodb.com/scale/what-is-a-non-relational-database>`_
   (or NoSQL databases) like MongoDB are for specific, niche use cases.

   MongoDB is a general-purpose database that can be used in a variety of
   use cases across nearly every industry. For more details, see `MongoDB
   Use Cases <https://www.mongodb.com/use-cases>`_, `MongoDB
   Industries <https://www.mongodb.com/industries>`_, and the `MongoDB Use
   Case Guidance
   Whitepaper <https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/use-case-guidance-where-to-use-mongodb>`_
   that includes a summary of when you should evaluate other database
   options.

   Another common question is, “If my data is relational, why would I use a
   `non-relational
   database <https://www.mongodb.com/scale/what-is-a-non-relational-database>`_?”

   MongoDB is considered a non-relational database. However, that doesn’t
   mean MongoDB doesn’t store relationship data well. (I know I just used a
   double-negative. Stick with me.) MongoDB stores relationship data in a
   different way. In fact, many consider the way MongoDB stores
   relationship data to be more intuitive and more reflective of the
   real-world relationships that are being modeled.

   Let’s take a look at how MongoDB stores data.

   .. _sql-mdb-1-document-model:

   The Document Model
   ------------------

   Instead of tables, MongoDB stores data in documents. No, Clippy, I’m not
   talking about Microsoft Word Documents.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/clippy.gif
      :alt: Clippy raises his eyebrows

   I’m talking about `BSON
   documents <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/>`_. BSON is a
   binary representation of `JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
   documents <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-json>`_.
   Documents will likely feel comfortable to you if you’ve used any of the
   C-family of programming languages such as C, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript,
   PHP, or Python.

   Documents typically store information about one object as well as any
   information related to that object. Related documents are grouped
   together in collections. Related collections are grouped together and
   stored in a database.

   Let’s discuss some of the basics of a document. Every document begins
   and ends with curly braces.

   .. code:: json

      {
      }

   Inside of those curly braces, you’ll find an unordered set of
   field/value pairs that are separated by commas.

   .. code:: json

      {
         field: value,
         field: value,
         field: value
      }

   The fields are strings that describe the pieces of data being stored.

   The values can be any of the `BSON <http://bsonspec.org/>`_ data types.
   BSON has a variety of `data
   types <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/>`_
   including Double, String, Object, Array, Binary Data, ObjectId, Boolean,
   Date, Null, Regular Expression, JavaScript, JavaScript (with scope),
   32-bit Integer, Timestamp, 64-bit Integer, Decimal128, Min Key, and Max
   Key. With all of these types available for you to use, you have the
   power to model your data as it exists in the real world.

   Every document is required to have a field named
   `_id <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/#the-id-field>`_.
   The value of ``_id`` must be unique for each document in a collection,
   is immutable, and can be of any type other than an array.

   .. _sql-mdb-1-example-docs:

   Example Documents
   -----------------

   Ok, that’s enough definitions. Let’s take a look at a real example, and
   compare and contrast how we would model the data in SQL vs MongoDB.

   Storing Leslie’s Information
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Let’s say we need to store information about a user named Leslie. We’ll
   store her contact information including her first name, last name, cell
   phone number, and city. We’ll also store some extra information about
   her including her location, hobbies, and job history.

   Storing Contact Information
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Let’s begin with Leslie’s contact information. When using SQL, we’ll
   create a table named ``Users``. We can create columns for each piece of
   contact information we need to store: first name, last name, cell phone
   number, and city. To ensure we have a unique way to identify each row,
   we’ll include an ID column.

   .. list-table:: Users
      :header-rows: 1
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - ID
        - first_name  
        - last_name
        - cell 
        - city 
      * - 1
        - Leslie
        - Yepp
        - 8125552344
        - Pawnee

   Now let’s store that same information in MongoDB. We can create a new
   document for Leslie where we’ll add field/value pairs for each piece of
   contact information we need to store. We’ll use ``_id`` to uniquely
   identify each document. We’ll store this document in a collection named
   ``Users``.

   Users 

   .. code:: json

      {
         "_id": 1,
         "first_name": "Leslie",
         "last_name": "Yepp",
         "cell": "8125552344",
         "city": "Pawnee"
      }

   Storing Latitude and Longitude
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Now that we’ve stored Leslie’s contact information, let’s store the
   coordinates of her current location.

   When using SQL, we’ll need to split the latitude and longitude between
   two columns.

   .. list-table:: Users
      :header-rows: 1
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - ID
        - first_name  
        - last_name
        - cell 
        - city 
        - latitude
        - longitude
      * - 1
        - Leslie
        - Yepp
        - 8125552344
        - Pawnee
        - 39.170344
        - -86.536632

   MongoDB has an array data type, so we can store the latitude and
   longitude together in a single field.

   Users 

   .. code:: json

      {
         "_id": 1,
         "first_name": "Leslie",
         "last_name": "Yepp",
         "cell": "8125552344",
         "city": "Pawnee",
         "location": [ -86.536632, 39.170344 ]
      }

   Bonus Tip: MongoDB has a few different built-in ways to visualize
   location data including the `schema analyzer in MongoDB
   Compass <https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/schema/#analyze-location-data>`_
   and the `Geospatial Charts in MongoDB
   Charts <https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/master/chart-type-reference/geo-spatial/>`_.
   I generated the map below with just a few clicks in MongoDB Charts.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/map.png
      :alt: Map of Leslie's location

   Storing Lists of Information
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   We’re successfully storing Leslie’s contact information and current
   location. Now let’s store her hobbies.

   When using SQL, we could choose to add more columns to the Users table.
   However, since a single user could have many hobbies (meaning we need to
   represent a one-to-many relationship), we’re more likely to create a
   separate table just for hobbies. Each row in the table will contain
   information about one hobby for one user. When we need to retrieve
   Leslie’s hobbies, we’ll join the ``Users`` table and our new ``Hobbies``
   table.

   .. list-table:: Hobbies
      :header-rows: 1
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - ID
        - user_id
        - hobby
      * - 10
        - 1
        - scrapbooking
      * - 11
        - 1
        - eating waffles
      * - 12
        - 1
        - working

   Since MongoDB supports arrays, we can simply add a new field named
   “hobbies” to our existing document. The array can contain as many or as
   few hobbies as we need (assuming we don’t exceed the `16 megabyte
   document size
   limit <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/#BSON-Document-Size>`_).
   When we need to retrieve Leslie’s hobbies, we don’t need to do an
   expensive join to bring the data together; we can simply retrieve her
   document in the ``Users`` collection.

   Users 

   .. code:: json

      {
         "_id": 1,
         "first_name": "Leslie",
         "last_name": "Yepp",
         "cell": "8125552344",
         "city": "Pawnee",
         "location": [ -86.536632, 39.170344 ],
         "hobbies": ["scrapbooking", "eating waffles", "working"]
      }

   .. _sql-mdb-1-job-history:

   Storing Groups of Related Information
   `````````````````````````````````````

   Let’s say we also need to store Leslie’s job history.

   Just as we did with hobbies, we’re likely to create a separate table
   just for job history information. Each row in the table will contain
   information about one job for one user.

   .. list-table:: JobHistory
      :header-rows: 1
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - ID
        - user_id
        - job_title
        - year_started
      * - 20
        - 1
        - “Deputy Director”
        - 2004
      * - 21
        - 1
        - “City Councillor”
        - 2012
      * - 22
        - 1
        - “Director, National Parks Service, Midwest Branch”
        - 2014

   So far in this article, we’ve used arrays in MongoDB to store
   geolocation data and a list of Strings. Arrays can contain values of any
   type, including objects. Let’s create a document for each job Leslie has
   held and store those documents in an array.


   Users 

   .. code:: json

      {
         "_id": 1,
         "first_name": "Leslie",
         "last_name": "Yepp",
         "cell": "8125552344",
         "city": "Pawnee",
         "location": [ -86.536632, 39.170344 ],
         "hobbies": ["scrapbooking", "eating waffles", "working"],
         "jobHistory": [
            {
               "title": "Deputy Director",
               "yearStarted": 2004
            },
            {
               "title": "City Councillor",
               "yearStarted": 2012
            },
            {
               "title": "Director, National Parks Service, Midwest Branch",
               "yearStarted": 2014
            }
         ]
      }

   Storing Ron’s Information
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Now that we’ve decided how we’ll store information about our users in
   both tables and documents, let’s store information about Ron. Ron will
   have almost all of the same information as Leslie. However, Ron does his
   best to stay off the grid, so he will not be storing his location in the
   system.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/erasepictures.gif
      :alt: Ron yells, "Erase all pictures of Ron!" at his tablet

   Skipping Location Data in SQL
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Let’s begin by examining how we would store Ron’s information in the
   same tables that we used for Leslie’s. When using SQL, we are required
   to input a value for every cell in the table. We will represent Ron’s
   lack of location data with ``NULL``. The problem with using ``NULL`` is
   that it’s unclear whether the data does not exist or if the data is
   unknown, so many people discourage the use of ``NULL``.

   .. list-table:: Users
      :header-rows: 1
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - ID
        - first_name  
        - last_name

      * - 24
        - 2
        - “CEO, Kinda Good Building Company”
        - 2014
      * - 25
        - 2
        - “Superintendent, Pawnee National Park”
        - 2018

   Skipping Location Data in MongoDB
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   In MongoDB, we have the option of representing Ron’s lack of location
   data in two ways: we can omit the ``location`` field from the document
   or we can set ``location`` to ``null``. Best practices suggest that we
   omit the ``location`` field to save space. You can choose if you want
   omitted fields and fields set to ``null`` to represent different things
   in your applications.

   Storing Lauren’s Information
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Let’s say we are feeling pretty good about our data models and decide to
   launch our apps using them.

   Then we discover we need to store information about a new user: Lauren
   Burhug. She’s a fourth grade student who Ron teaches about government.
   We need to store a lot of the same information about Lauren as we did
   with Leslie and Ron: her first name, last name, city, and hobbies.
   However, Lauren doesn’t have a cell phone, location
   data, or job history. We also discover that we need to store a new piece
   of information: her school.

   Storing New Information in SQL
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Let’s begin by storing Lauren’s information in the SQL tables as they
   already exist.

   We have two options for storing information about Lauren’s school. We
   can choose to add a column to the existing Users table, or we can create
   a new table. Let’s say we choose to add a column named “school” to the
   Users table. Depending on our access rights to the database, we may need
   to talk to the DBA and convince them to add the field. Most likely, the
   database will need to be taken down, the “school” column will need to be
   added, NULL values will be stored in every row in the Users table where
   a user does not have a school, and the database will need to be brought
   back up.

   Storing New Information in MongoDB
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Let’s examine how we can store Lauren’s information in MongoDB.


   Users 

   .. code:: json

      {
         "_id": 3,
         "first_name": "Lauren",
         "last_name": "Burhug",
         "city": "Pawnee",
         "hobbies": ["soccer"],
         "school": "Pawnee Elementary"
      }

   As you can see above, we’ve added a new field named “school” to Lauren’s
   document. We do not need to make any modifications to Leslie’s document
   or Ron’s document when we add the new “school” field to Lauren’s
   document. MongoDB has a flexible schema, so every document in a
   collection does not need to have the same fields.

   For those of you with years of experience using SQL databases, you might
   be starting to panic at the idea of a flexible schema. (I know I started
   to panic a little when I was introduced to the idea.)

      :alt: April screams in terror

   Don’t panic! This flexibility can be hugely valuable as your
   application’s requirements evolve and change.

   MongoDB provides `schema
   validation <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/>`_
   so you can lock down your schema as much or as little as you’d like when
   you’re ready.

   Mapping Terms and Concepts from SQL to MongoDB
   ----------------------------------------------

   Now that we’ve compared how you model data in SQL and MongoDB, let’s be
   a bit more explicit with the terminology. Let’s map terms and concepts
   from SQL to MongoDB.

   Row ⇒ Document
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A row maps roughly to a document.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/rowdocument.png
      :alt: Row and document

   Depending on how you’ve normalized your data, rows across several tables
   could map to a single document. In our examples above, we saw that rows
   for Leslie in the ``Users``, ``Hobbies``, and ``JobHistory`` tables
   mapped to a single document.

   Column ⇒ Field
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A column maps roughly to a field. For example, when we modeled Leslie’s
   data, we had a ``first_name`` column in the Users table and a
   ``first_name`` field in a User document.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/columnfield.png
      :alt: Column and field

   Table ⇒ Collection
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A table maps roughly to a collection. Recall that a collection is a
   group of documents. Continuing with our example above, our ``Users``
   table maps to our ``Users`` collection.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/tablecollection.png
      :alt: Table and collection

   Database ⇒ Database
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The term ``database`` is used fairly similarly in both SQL and MongoDB.
   Groups of tables are stored in SQL databases just as groups of
   collections are stored in MongoDB databases.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/databasedatabase.png 
      :alt: SQL Database and MongoDB Database

   Index ⇒ Index
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Indexes provide fairly similar functionality in both SQL and MongoDB.
   Indexes are data structures that optimize queries. You can think of them
   like an index that you’d find in the back of a book; indexes tell the
   database where to look for specific pieces of information. Without an
   index, all information in a table or collection must be searched.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/indexindex.png
      :alt: SQL Index and MongoDB Index

   New MongoDB users often forget how much indexes can impact performance.
   If you have a query that is taking a long time to run, be sure you have
   an index to support it. For example, if we know we will be commonly
   searching for users by first or last name, we should add a text index on
   the first and last name fields.

   Remember: indexes slow down write performance but speed up read
   performance. For more information on indexes including the types of
   indexes that MongoDB supports, see the `MongoDB
   Manual <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/>`_.

   View ⇒ View
   ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Views are fairly similar in both SQL and MongoDB. In MongoDB, a view is
   defined by an aggregation pipeline. The results of the view are not
   stored—they are generated every time the view is queried.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/viewview.png
      :alt: SQL View and MongoDB View

   To learn more about views, see the `MongoDB
   Manual <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/views/>`_.

   MongoDB added support for On-Demand Materialized Views in version 4.2.
   To learn more, see the `MongoDB
   Manual <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/materialized-views/>`_.

   Join ⇒ Embedding
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   When you use SQL databases, joins are fairly common. You normalize your
   data to prevent data duplication, and the result is that you commonly
   need to join information from multiple tables in order to perform a
   single operation in your application

   In MongoDB, we encourage you to model your data differently. Our rule of
   thumb is *Data that is accessed together should be stored together*. If
   you’ll be frequently creating, reading, updating, or deleting a chunk of
   data together, you should probably be storing it together in a document
   rather than breaking it apart across several documents.

   You can use embedding to model data that you may have broken out into
   separate tables when using SQL. When we modeled Leslie’s data for
   MongoDB earlier, we saw that :ref:`we embedded her job history in her
   User document <sql-mdb-1-job-history>` instead of creating a separate
   ``JobHistory`` document.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/joinembedding.png
      :alt: SQL Join and MongoDB Embedding

   For more information, see the MongoDB Manual’s pages on `modeling
   one-to-one relationships with
   embedding <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/model-embedded-one-to-one-relationships-between-documents/>`_
   and `modeling one-to-many relationships with
   embedding <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/model-embedded-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents/>`_.

   Join ⇒ Database References
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   As we discussed in the previous section, embedding is a common solution
   for modeling data in MongoDB that you may have split across one or more
   tables in a SQL database.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/joindbref.png
      :alt: SQL Join and MongoDB Database Reference

   However, sometimes embedding does not make sense. Let’s say we wanted to
   store information about our Users’ employers like their names,
   addresses, and phone numbers. The number of Users that could be
   associated with an employer is unbounded. If we were to embed
   information about an employer in a ``User`` document, the employer data
   could be replicated hundreds or perhaps thousands of times. Instead, we
   can create a new ``Employers`` collection and create a database
   reference between ``User`` documents and ``Employer`` documents.

   For more information on modeling one-to-many relationships with
   database references, see the `MongoDB
   Manual <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/model-referenced-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents/>`_.

   Left Outer Join ⇒ $lookup (Aggregation Pipeline)
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   When you need to pull all of the information from one table and join it
   with any matching information in a second table, you can use a left
   outer join in SQL.

   MongoDB has a stage similar to a left outer join that you can use with
   the aggregation framework.

   For those not familiar with the aggregation framework, it allows you to
   analyze your data in real-time. Using the framework, you can create an
   aggregation pipeline that consists of one or more stages. Each stage
   transforms the documents and passes the output to the next stage.

   $lookup is an aggregation framework stage that allows you to perform a
   left outer join to an unsharded collection in the same database. 

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/joinlookup.png
      :alt: SQL Left Outer Join and MongoDB $lookup

   For more information, see the MongoDB Manual’s pages on the `aggregation
   framework <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/index.html>`_
   and
   `$lookup <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/index.html>`_.
   MongoDB University has a fantastic free course on the aggregation
   pipeline that will walk you in detail through using ``$lookup``: `M121:
   The MongoDB Aggregation Framework <http://bit.ly/MDBU_m121>`_.

   Recursive Common Table Expressions ⇒ $graphLookup (Aggregation Pipeline)
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   When you need to query hierarchical data like a company’s organization
   chart in SQL, we can use recursive common table expressions.

   MongoDB provides an aggregation framework stage that is similar to
   recursive common table expressions: ``$graphLookup``. ``$graphLookup``
   performs a recursive search on a collection.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/rctegraphlookup.png
      :alt: SQL Recursive Common Table Expressions and $graphLookup

   For more information, see the MongoDB Manual’s page on
   `$graphLookup <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/>`_
   and `MongoDB University’s free course on the aggregation
   framework <http://bit.ly/MDBU_m121>`_.

   .. _sql-mdb-1-transactions-mapping:

   Multi-Record ACID Transaction ⇒ Multi-Document ACID Transaction
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Finally, let’s talk about `ACID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID>`_
   transactions. Transactions group database operations together so they
   all succeed or none succeed. In SQL, we call these multi-record ACID
   transactions. In MongoDB, we call these multi-document ACID
   transactions.

   Manual <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/transactions/>`_.

   Wrap Up
   -------

   We’ve just covered a lot of concepts and terminology. The three term
   mappings I recommend you internalize as you get started using MongoDB
   are: 
   
   * Rows map to documents. 
   * Columns map to fields. 
   * Tables map to collections.

   I created the following diagram you can use as a reference in the future
   as you begin your journey using MongoDB.
